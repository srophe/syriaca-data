    "abstractNote": "The aim of this study is to develop a more effective translation technique analysis of the Peshitta to Ezekiel text that would contribute to the textual studies of Ezekiel. In order to help provide such an effective analysis on translation technique, the methodology employed is the comparative analysis of texts, which incorporates the theory from Cognitive Semantics called Frame Semantics. This theory views units of meaning in text or speech contexts at the level of semantic frames and is therefore most ideal in view of the idiomatic nature of the Peshitta translation. By applying this theory, the frames in the Hebrew source text of the translator were compared to those in the translator\u2019s target Syriac text, to see whether there were correspondences between the two frames. In chapter 3, the GIVING frames evoked by \u05e0\u05ea\u05df (n\u0101tan) were studied and it was found that most of the frames in the Hebrew text corresponded well with those in the Syriac target text. The exception is mainly those frames in which there might have been textual difficulties in the source text. Similar observations were made in chapter 4 for the ARRIVING frames evoked by the Hebrew verb \u05d1\u05d5\u05d0 (b\u014d). However, nouns associated with the frame MISDEEDS presented some problems, mainly as to their use in the Hebrew source text. The use of these nouns could have affected the translator\u2019s understanding of such categories, leading to their inconsistent representation in the target text. Nevertheless, it can be indicated that the translator demonstrated a relatively good understanding of the use of the nouns in the Hebrew text. Overall, the translation of the Peshitta to Ezekiel was made at the approximate level of semantic frames, displaying a translation technique that should be very useful for the textual studies of the Book of Ezekiel.",
