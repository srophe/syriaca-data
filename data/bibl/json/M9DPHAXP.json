    "abstractNote": "Prior to the schism of the Syriac Christian churches in the mid-fifth century CE, the renowned poet and teacher Ephrem of Nisibis (ca. 307-73) was the most influential figure in the Syriac Christian tradition. Later Syriac Christians would come to revere Ephrem in large part for his accomplishments as a teacher of Christian Scripture. Despite renewed scholarly interest in Ephrem in recent decades, however, scholarship on his biblical exegesis remains rather fragmented. This dissertation examines Ephrem\u2019s literary corpus with an eye to his practices as a reader and interpreter of Scripture. While the current scholarship has tended to emphasize Ephrem\u2019s theological hermeneutic of Scripture, this dissertation argues that no single exegetical method unites Ephrem\u2019s diverse corpus of hymns, homilies, commentaries, and polemical discourses, which were by nature occasional compositions. Rather, Ephrem used a variety of exegetical practices to bring Scripture\u2019s words and imagery to bear in various literary genres and performative contexts. Given the broad scope of the topic, this study focuses on Ephrem\u2019s use of one particular cluster of biblical passages\u2014the Gospel accounts of the suffering and death of Jesus (identified hereafter as \u201cthe Passion narrative\u201d). Ephrem regularly cites, references, and alludes to the Passion narrative throughout his corpus, making it a valuable case study for exploring how he engaged with, drew from, and transformed biblical sources.\nThe argument of this dissertation proceeds in two stages. The first chapter serves as a prolegomenon to those that follow, outlining Ephrem\u2019s exegetical methods and practices in the various literary genres in which he wrote. The following chapters (two through four) proceed to examine the three most common thematic motifs associated with the Passion narrative in Ephrem\u2019s writings: anti-Jewish polemic (chapter two); payment of human debt (chapter three); and finally, the climactic victory of life over death (chapter four). Each of these chapters contributes further evidence to support the contention that Ephrem\u2019s exegesis was fundamentally occasional, inextricably linked to the unique contexts and audiences of each of his many writings.",
