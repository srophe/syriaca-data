    "abstractNote": "In the first part of this article, an attempt is made to reconstruct the Christological system of the Jacobite theologian Abu Ra\u2019ita at-Takriti (1st half of the 9th century). Abu Ra\u2019ita teaches about one essence of the incarnate God the Word, which is composed of two essences \u2014 Divine and human. However, for at-Takriti, the unity of essence does not mean the merging of Divinity and humanity in the sense of the formation of a new property; he recognizes the preservation of the qualitative difference between the components of the composition (\u201cdifference in natural quiddity\u201d). Abu Ra\u2019ita\u2019s Christological polemics indicate that he does not make a fundamental distinction between Orthodox Chalcedonian Christology and Nestorianism. In the second part a comparison is made of the Christological systems of Abu Ra\u2019ita and Severus of Antioch, as a result of which it is established that, from the point of view of both Christological problematics and the theological language used, there are very significant differences between the two authors. The final part notes the features of the Christological teaching of Abu Ra\u2019ita. He understands the incarnation not as a unity of two essences, but rather as a kind of \u201cdevelopment\u201d of substance (\u1e0f\u0101t) of the Word: the Son of God acquires new, human, essential properties, and the complexity of His essence after incarnation lies in the fact that He has two rows of essential attributes (a\u1e63-\u1e63ifat\u0101n) \u2014 Divine and human. Unlike Severus, who resolutely rejected the doctrine of the unity of the essence of Christ, at-Takriti conceives of the complex essence of the incarnate Word in fact as a new species, although represented by only one individual. In this respect, Abu Ra\u2019ita is close to Sergius the Grammarian, one of Severus\u2019 opponents within the Monophysite camp. According to formal criteria, Abu Ra\u2019ita\u2019s Christology should be qualified as a type of moderate monophysitism. However, it is absolutely impossible to consider Abu Ra\u2019ita as a successor of the Severian tradition. His doctrine is an example of a significantly different and, moreover, more radical Monophysite teaching.",
