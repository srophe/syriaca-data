    "abstractNote": "It is commonly believed that of the two West Syriac chronicles that have preserved large parts of the now lost Chronicle of Dionysius of Tell-Ma\u1e25r\u0113 (d. 845), the account of the rise of Islam is better preserved in the anonymous Chronicle up to the Year 1234 than it is in the Chronicle of Michael Rab\u014d (d. 1199). In addition to the overall preference for Chron. 1234 over Michael\u2019s Chronicle that has emerged in recent scholarship, this view is based on the assumption that the polemical elements found only in Michael\u2019s version are more likely his own additions than omissions by the Anonymous Chronicler. On the basis of a new dependant, Dionysius bar \u1e62al\u012bb\u012b (d. 1171), this article argues that Michael, followed by Bar \u1e62al\u012bb\u012b, rather than the Anonymous Chronicler, have more fully and faithfully preserved the original account on the rise of Islam. This argument is developed in three steps. First, evidence is presented that Bar \u1e62al\u012bb\u012b borrowed his account of the rise of Islam as narrated in the opening chapter of his Disputation against the Muslims directly from Dionysius of Tell-Ma\u1e25r\u0113. Secondly, the redactions by the three dependants are assessed. Having sifted the dependants\u2019 adaptations from what is most likely original, finally a tentative reconstruction of Dionysius\u2019 account in English translation is provided. A synopsis of the three dependent texts in English translation is appended.",
