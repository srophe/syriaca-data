    "abstractNote": "This is the first English translation, with an introduction, a few notes, and brief appendix, of the surviving Greek fragments of Theodore\u2019s Commentary, written probably some time in the first decade of the fifth century. The 140 fragments, drawn from various catenae, were collected after critical evaluation and published in 1948 by Robert Devreesse in an edition which superseded that reproduced in Migne, PG 66. A Syriac version of the Commentary, published in CSCO by Vost\u00e9 in 1940, shows differences from the Greek. These are imperfectly explained here in the appendix as adaptations of the work to the Syriac Bible text and to East Syrian dualist Christology. It is as probable that Theodore\u2019s characteristic approach was toned down for a catena as enhanced by a translator. The quotations selected for the catenae deal with straightforward questions of the meaning of words, of narrative structure, and the like: with what is necessary to understand the text in the ordinary sense of \u2018understand\u2019. Dr Kalantzis has done a useful piece of work. He attends too much to Theodore\u2019s Christology in the introduction and mounts in incongruous and anachronistic terms an apparent defence of its conformity with the standard Patristic model: Theodore is credited with belief in \u2018theandric activity\u2019 and \u2018hypostatic union\u2019. This is a pity because it misses the point of the quotations preserved in Greek because of Theodore\u2019s perceived value to biblical study, besides sounding so oldfashioned. But, of course, it must be allowed that dismantling catenae in the hope of recovering a lost work was never the best way to understand them or the texts they contain in the first place. [L. R.
