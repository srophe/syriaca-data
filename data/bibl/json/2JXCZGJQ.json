    "abstractNote": "The current ecumenical search for unity in the Church recognizes the need for a Petrine ministry in the universal Church. The present study explores the typology of Peter in the works of Aphrahat the Persian Sage, the first father of the Syriac Church, who sees Simon Peter as a type. In a first section, all the texts of Aphrahat on Peter are collected. Section two is devoted to an exegetical study of these texts grouped under five heads: Peter as a witness, foundation-rock, under-shepherd, key-holder, and head of the disciples. Peter is all this but is also a type. The typology of Peter was common to the Fathers of the early Church of the East and of the West like Ephrem, Origen and Chrysostom; Tertullian, Cyprian and Augustine (section three). However, in the West the typology of Peter was progressively replaced by the imperial model (section four). For the current ecumenical quest to succeed it seems necessary to recover the Petrine typology so that the primatial Church authority be effectively in the service of the unity of the universal Church according to a recognized model of the exercise of public authority in modern times (fifth section). In conclusion, it would seem that the typology of Peter suggests also a \u201cprimacy of repentance\u201d with the papacy taking the lead in ecumenical repentance thus leading to the recovery of unity of a reconciled Church.",
