    "abstractNote": "The Anaphora of Addai and Mari has long been regarded as anomalous and problematic because it does not contain the institution narrative with the words of consecration \u201cThis is my body, This is my blood.\u201d This problem was brought to a head with the official Roman approval in 2001 of this anaphora for valid eucharistic celebration. But since the eucharist was celebrated at first without the institution narrative in the early Church, also in Rome, the present article argues that the real problem is its subsequent addition. This was indeed a legitimate liturgical development, but not a theological necessity. In the parallel case of baptism, the Church obeyed the command of Jesus to baptize without reciting any institution narrative of baptism. The Church can do likewise and fulfil Jesus\u2019 command without reciting any institution narrative of the eucharist. Its use will be necessary insofar as it is prescribed by the Church, which has the power to specify the \u201cform\u201d of the sacraments. What is essential is for the Church to do what Jesus commanded, not also recite as a mantra the command or the reason given for the command.",
