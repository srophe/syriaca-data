    "abstractNote": "\"In 1026, the Nestorian bishop Elijah had a celebrated series of debates at Nisibis with the Muslim vizier al-Maghribi, in which the bishop claimed that the superiority of the Syriac language over Arabic is demonstrated by the fact that the Arabs learnt much about the science through Syriac sources, while the opposite was not true. Two centuries later, Barhebraeus complained that Syriac Christians had now to turn to the Arabs for science. That author surveys the period between the Nisibis conversations of 1026 and the death of bishop of Abdisho in 1318, and shows the enrichment for Syriac culture which accrued on the one hand from a new openness among Syriac Christians to foreign Christian traditions, and on the other hand from their contacts with Arabic culture. These two influences were linked. Anxious to prove to their Muslim neighbours that Christianity is not divided. Syriac Christian authors such as Rabban Yeshou, Abdisho, Barhebraeus and Ali Daoud al-Arfadi, began to emphasise their openness to Byzantine and even Latin expressions of Christianity. While Elijah seems to be the fisrt major Syriac scholar to have written both in Syriac and in Arabic, during the period under study, Arabic culture and science had growing influence on Syriac writers. Some of them, such as Dionysius Barsalibi, use their knowledge of Arabic culture for apologetic reasons. Barhebraeus emphasised the spiritual pilgrimage to Mecca, and from the spiritual accent given to Muslim religious practice by Al-Ghazali.\" (p. 194)",
