    "abstractNote": "Part one looks at The Malankara Church and Its Relation with the Jacobite Patriarch of Antioch, part two at The Reunion and the Juridical Constitution of the Syro-Malabar Rite by the Holy See. \"The early Christian community of Malabar was of one faith and rite until its division into two Christian denominations, one remaining under Latin bishops and the other denying obedience to them. But the latter did not continue to remain in their wavering state but formed an independent Church and cherished a communion with the Jacobite Patriarch of Antioch. This Church we refer to as the Malankara Church in this book. The Malankara Church made serious attempts at reunion with the Apostolic See of Rome and was ultimately successful. As a result the Catholic Malankara Church came into existence. We use the term \"Malankara Catholic Church\" or \"Syro-Malabar Church\" to denote the community reunited with Rome in contradistinction to its counterpart the \"Malankara Orthodox Church\" which is not in communion with the Roman Pontiff\u2026. Our study, being juridical in its purpose, is not a study of the history of the Malankara Church either Catholic of Orthodox. But very often we found it necessary to bring relevant historical circumstances and facts to bear on the juridical points involved, for, without them our discussion would be incomplete. Hence much of our discussion is historico-juridical and for this reason our method too may bear that name\" (from the author's introduction). With a bibliography and an index.",
