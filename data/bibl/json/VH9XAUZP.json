    "abstractNote": "It has long been recognized that Old Testament citations appear in the Old Syriac Gospels in ways quite different from the way they appear in the Greek Gospels. Because the Old Syriac Gospels stand as witnesses to Tatian's Diatessaron, a second-century Syriac Gospel harmony, it has been argued that this phenomenon of variant Old Testament citations is a characteristic of the Diatessaron, and that the Old Syriac Gospels received these variant citations from the Diatessaron. Moreover, many of the Old Testament citations in the Old Syriac/Diatessaron stand closer to Hebrew text traditions and other Jewish exegetical traditions, a dynamic which has been explained on the theory that Tatian used the Old Testament Peshitta, the Old Testament of the Syriac church (which was translated from the Hebrew Bible), in the creation of the Diatessaron. In this dissertation, I demonstrate on the contrary that when Old Testament citations in the Diatessaron are accurately reconstructed, there is little evidence that Tatian assimilated these citations to the text of the Old Testament Peshitta. Rather, Tatian took over the Old Testament citations in the form he found them in the Gospel sources he used in the creation of the Diatessaron in the second century. Where they vary from the form these citations take in the Greek Gospel tradition, it is because Tatian possessed an earlier form of the Gospel texts than what is preserved in the Greek manuscript tradition of the fourth century and later. In preserving an older, and possibly more original, form of many of these citations, Tatian's Diatessaron stands as an important early witness to the state of the Gospel tradition in the second century and sheds light on the issue of the status and function of the various versions of the Bible in early Syriac Christianity.",
