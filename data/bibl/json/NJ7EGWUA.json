    "abstractNote": "St. Ephrem was the greatest of the Syriac fathers of the Church, who was born in 306 in Nissivi, a city in Mesopotamia, from Christian parents. St. Ephrem is regarded as one of the greatest ecclesiastical writers of the Ancient Church. In the first part of this paper there is an analysis of a fresco on the theme of the Dormition of St. Ephrem the Syriac (1568), which is located at the Monastery of Docheiariou on Mount Athos, Greece. In the second part of this work, by reason of the fresco of the Dormition of St. Ephrem, the teaching on the \u201cmemory of death\u201d is presented followed by its significance according to the theology of the Orthodox Church. In the third and final part of the work, the funeral traditions of the Byzantine era have been included. These traditions are being followed up to today during the passing away and the burial of monks, in the monastic state of Mount Athos in Greece. The purpose of the artistic and theological analysis of the fresco on the Dormition of St. Ephrem the Syrian as well as the presentation of funerary customs, following the death of an Athonite monk since the Byzantine era to this day, is to emphasize the unusual phenomenon of fearlessness towards death.",
