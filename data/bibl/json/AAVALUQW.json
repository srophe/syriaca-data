    "abstractNote": "At present there is no concordance to the Syriac <i>Acts of Thomas</i>. The lack of a concordance hobbles research into this early third-century Christian apocryphal acts. A Greek concordance already exists. In order to study the <i>Acts of Thomas</i> with any confidence a concordance is necessary for both the Greek and the Syriac. Research interests in the <i>Acts</i> revolve around a number of areas, including, but not limited to the following: (1) Translation Direction: The question concerning the <i>Acts</i>' original language remains, was it Greek or Syriac? (2) Sacraments: The <i>Acts of Thomas</i> offer insights from early Christianity concerning Baptism and Eucharist. (3) Biblical texts and Translations: The text retains readings which can be classified as belonging to the Old Syriac Gospels and possibly to the Diatesseron. (4) The Thomas Tradition: The <i>Acts</i> are part of the Thomas Tradition. (5) Apocryphal Acts of the Apostles: The <i>Acts</i> are one of the five great apocryphal acts of the apostles. (6) Gender Studies: Women play a crucial part in most of the individual stories which form the <i>Acts</i>. (7) Jewish-Christian Relations: There appear to be connections between some portions of the <i>Acts</i> and portions of the Talmud. None of these areas of research can be fully undertaken without a concordance to the Syriac <i>Acts of Thomas</i>. To this end, I have automated the Syriac text of the <i>Acts of Thomas</i> as found in the 1871 William Wright edition of the British Museum manuscript additional 14,645. I have developed a concordance which emphasizes automation and grammatical classification of the text. My aim is two-fold, to offer a grammatical concordance to Acts 1 and 2, and to exploit modern word processing software to be able to conduct this research without having to take courses in computer programming. Acts 1 and 2 circulated separately from the entire thirteen act version, so a concordance to those two acts will be immediately useful for research on the <i>Acts of Thomas</i>.",
