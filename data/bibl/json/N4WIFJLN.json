    "abstractNote": "Previous scholarly consensus held that the text preserved in the Latin <i>Actus Vercellenses</i> was a relatively faithful translation of a second-century Greek <i>Acts of Peter</i>. In partial support of this date was the posited intertextual relationship with the <i>Acts of Paul</i>, with particular attention given to the so-called \"quo vadis\" scenes related in both apocryphal acts. More recent scholarship has cast doubt on this, thus removing the terminus ad quem of a late second-century date that this posited relationship provided. Taking this as his starting point, Matthew Baldwin's work constitutes a formidable challenge to previous consensus of both the date and the faithfulness of the Latin translation. He argues that the <i>Vercelli Acts</i> should be understood as a fourth-century product in its own right and of no value for recovering an earlier <i>Acts of Peter</i>. While some brief counterarguments to this have been offered, to the best of my knowledge none have yet incorporated the fourth-century Syriac <i>History of Simon Cephas, Chief of the Apostles</i>, which has extensive parallels with the <i>Vercelli Acts</i>. Doing so lends additional evidence to the priority of the <i>Acts of Peter</i>, as well as potentially verifies scholarly argument regarding a redactional history of the <i>Acts of Peter</i> in the second century. As a fourth-century composition itself that includes material reflecting this date, it is also useful in comparison with details preserved in the <i>Vercelli Acts</i> that scholars have suggested attest to the preservation of earlier material. Taken together, these three avenues of discussion can potentially reinstate the consensus regarding the existence of a second-century Acts of Peter that is more or less faithfully preserved in the <i>Vercelli Acts</i>.",
