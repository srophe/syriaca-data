    "abstractNote": "Narsai\u2019s homily \u201cAbout the Fathers, the Teachers Diodore of Tarsos, Theodore of Mopsuestia and Nestorios\u201d, is a document of primary importance for reconstructing the process that finally led to the separation of the East Syriac Church from both its Miaphysite neighbours and the Chalcedonian Byzantine Orthodoxy. In this homily an \u201cofficial speaker\u201d of the East Syriac Dyophysites, such as Narsai, for the first time overtly declares Nestorios to be a theological ancestor of the tradition he stands for and rejects Chalcedon, thus taking an unequivocal stand on two issues that were open for discussion up to then. The question this article poses is: What were the intentions of the author when he took these ground-breaking steps? Which audience did he have in mind and what did he wish to achieve with this homily? The primary audience of the homily could have well been the students and teachers of the School of Nisibis. However, as the historical context of its composition and its wide dissemination may show, Narsai meant this homily to serve a bigger cause: To spread the views of the \u201cTheodoran\u201d party, to which he adhered (further leading personalities being Barsauma of Nisibis and the Catholicos Aqaq), as widely as possible among the Syriac communities on Sassanian territory and their bishops. These views entailed a resoluteness to defend \u201cTheodoran\u201d orthodoxy even at the cost of breaking with the \u201cWestern\u201d Churches, and it was primarily this resoluteness that Narsai, presumably in cooperation with Barsauma, wanted to convey to the East Syriac clergy and its leadership when writing this homily.",
