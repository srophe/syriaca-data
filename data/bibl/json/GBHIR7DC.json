    "abstractNote": "Today the city of \u1e2aarr\u0101n/Carrhae is mainly known for the famous battle, in which the Roman general Crassus was defeated by a Parthian army in 53 BCE. However, \u1e2aarr\u0101n was also one of the most important religious centres of North Mesopotamia. Since the Bronze Age, the moon god S\u00een of \u1e2aarr\u0101n was popular in the wider region, and it is well known that the late Assyrian and Baby- lonian kings supported the cult and rebuilt the temple of S\u00een. Archaeological evidence and written sources attest to the great popularity of S\u00een of \u1e2aarr\u0101n at that time. Much less is known about the development of the cult in the subsequent periods, but the evidence assembled in this paper in- dicates that it continued to thrive. An important but so far largely ignored source for the study of S\u00een are coins, which were minted at \u1e2aarr\u0101n in the second and third century CE. They suggest that some distinctive features of the Iron Age cult still existed in the Roman period. Most important in this regard is the predominance of aniconic symbolism. A cult standard, a crescent on a globe with tassels mounted on a pole, continued to be the main of representation of the god. In addition, two versions of an anthropomorphic image of the god can be traced in the coinage of \u1e2aarr\u0101n. The first shows him as an enthroned mature man. It is based on the model of Zeus, but his attributes iden- tify the god as S\u00een. The second version portrays him as a youthful, beardless god.\nLate antique sources frequently mention that the people of \u1e2aarr\u0101n remained attached to pagan religion, but the veracity of these accounts must be questioned. A reassessment of the literary and archaeological evidence suggests that the accounts of a pagan survival at \u1e2aarr\u0101n are hyperbolic and exacer ated by negative sentiments towards \u1e2aarr\u0101n among writer from the neighbouring city of Edessa.",
