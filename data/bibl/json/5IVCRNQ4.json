    "abstractNote": "The <i>sigillion </i>as a caliphal diploma for patriarchs, particularly in the Miaphysite/ Syrian-Orthodox Church, remains an under-researched aspect of early Islamicate Eastern Christianity. Drawing on the writings of Patriarch Dionysius of Tell-Ma\u1e25r\u0113 (r. 818\u2013845), this article examines how this type of document was used both to formalize ecclesiastical authority, and to confirm ancient political and fiscal privileges.\nFirst appearing in Egyptian papyri, as well as in Syriac and Muslim historiography in the early Islamic period, both <i>sijill </i>and <i>sigillion </i>likely derived from a local adaptation of the Latin <i>sigillum</i>, and/or reflect a pre-existing Semitic usage. Its origin can be traced to the Diocese Orientis (<i>Bil\u0101d al-Sh\u0101m</i>) and/or Northern Arabia before its introduction to Egypt after the Arab conquest.\nIts function extended beyond a simple \u2018safe-conduct\u2019 or \u2018fiscal grant\u2019: it might primarily be conceptualized as a formal \u2018mission order,\u2019 with a folded \u2013 and sealed \u2013 bottom, reserved for authorized administrators to verify the holder\u2019s claim. The <i>sigillion </i>could grant exceptional rights or appointments, such as exemption from corv\u00e9e labor, internal passports for movement, state revenue allocations, or the authority to request law enforcement support.\nIn the mid-8th century, emirs, particularly in Northern Mesopotamia, began issuing <i>sigillia </i>to prelates, metropolitans, and patriarchs. Over time, this practice gained acknowledgment from the Caliphate, establishing the <i>sigillion </i>as a legitimate and official document for patriarchal claims during the Great Schism of the Syrian-Orthodox Church (ca. 754\u2013785). The Church eventually embraced this caliphal recognition as part of its ecclesiastical authority, marking a significant shift in its integration into the structures of the Islamic state and Christian clerical leadership.",
