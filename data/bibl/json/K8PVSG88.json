    "abstractNote": "According to Theodore of Mopsuestia, death is not only punishment for men but also an important educational tool. It is precisely because men are mortal that they have been able to appreciate the value of immortality and to become aware of the wretchedness of their situation. At the same time, Adam\u2019s sin brought man\u2019s changeable nature to a state of confusion, which, in turn, provoked an out-pour of passions. This event brought sin to man, yet it also taught man to search for a proper solution to this problem.  The Antiochian thinker is convinced that God not only wanted to teach men how to live right but also to give them the opportunity to choose between dedicating their lives to God and dedicating them to evil.  The very possibility for sin (peccato aditum) has been given to men as an educational tool: sin represented a necessary choice, and not only the actual choice of sin but also the opportunity to choose God. Making good moral choices is man\u2019s highest pursuit. In Theodore\u2019s logic, the sensibility of human nature is inevitably accompanied by changeability.  Hence, man needs to be able to make a free choice because man is a reasonable being. As part of his educational mission, God has also given men orders, laws that help man regulate his present life (\u03ba\u03b1\u03c4\u1f70 \u03c4\u1f78\u03bd \u03c0\u03b1\u03c1\u03cc\u03bd\u03c4\u03b1 \u03b2\u03af\u03bf\u03bd): life in man\u2019s first state, the first epoch of the oikonomia of salvation.",
