    "abstractNote": "The <i>Sentences of the Syriac Menander</i> is a document which appears in two separate Syriac manuscripts located at the British Library in London. The full version is found in Or. Add. 14.658, and a far shorter version, comprising only a small fraction of the full text, is found in Or. Add. 14.614. This dissertation presents a commentary on the text in its complete version focusing on parallel texts from both the Jewish tradition and from the Greco-Roman world, and advancing the thesis that the text is a Jewish pseudepigraphon composed in Syriac in Edessa and preserved within Christian monastic circles. Chapter I: Introduction traces previous scholarship on the document, reconstructs the history of the manuscript itself and explains how it ended up at the British Library, attempts to date both the text as it presently stands and the text underlying it, gives information concerning the provenance of the material, its organization, and the language of the text, comments on the genre of the material, the attribution of the text to the Greek author Menander, and discusses The Sentences of the Syriac Menander as a Jewish pseudepigraphon. Chapter II: Text and Translation will present the first rendition of the Syriac text since the initial work of J.P.N. Land in the 19th century, taken from an observation of the manuscript itself and with the benefit of modern lighting and visual aids, along with philological and other textual notes on the Syriac text of the treatise itself, and presenting a new English translation of the material. Chapter III: Commentary will be a continuous commentary on the full text, and Chapter IV: Conclusion will attempt to set forth what the parallels and comments in the third chapter have to teach about the reception of biblical and extra-biblical material in a part of the world of early Christianity about which not a great deal is known.",
