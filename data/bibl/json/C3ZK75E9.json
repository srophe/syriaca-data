    "abstractNote": "\"Burkitt's suggestion was that Rabbula as soon as he became bishop in Edessa in the year 411 A.D. made this new version, introduced it, established it in Edessa and everywhere in Mesopotamia, and thereby determined the history of the New Testament text in the Syrian Church. [...] Close investigation of the Syriac patristic sources teaches us that this \"final decision\" about the origin of the Peshitta, is nothing more than premature. The testimony of the sources is absolitely different.\" \"Here I should like to call attention to the oldest dated Syriac manuscript in the British Museum, MS. Add. 12.150.\" \"On the basis of these two lists of readings, one conclusion forces itself upon us: that our translator has used a Gospel text which was not an Old Syriac type, but he lived in the vocabulary and phraseology of a text-type, the physiognomy of which is clearly pictured as a revised Gospel text which later was called the Peshitta.\" \"Consequently the text type which became known as the Peshitta was in circulation among learned circles in Mesopotamia during the second half of the 4th century, certainly already before Rabbula was converted to the Christian faith and before he saw any of the New Testament writings.\" (pp. 191; 193; 202; 204)",
