    "abstractNote": "This contribution explores the narrations and narrative styles of three Syriac authors and genocide survivors from the Diyarbak\u0131r province of the Ottoman Empire: Naaman Abed Qarabashi, Ish\u0101q bar Armalto (Armale) and Henno, comparing them with the Armenian and Greek survivors Rev. Grigoris Balakian (\u0533\u0580\u056b\u0563\u0578\u0580\u056b\u057d \u054a\u0561\u056c\u0561\u0563\u0565\u0561\u0576, Grigoris Palagean), Yervant Odian (\u0535\u0580\u0578\u0582\u0561\u0576\u0564 \u0555\u057f\u0565\u0561\u0576 \u2013 Eruand \u014ctean), Elias Venezis and Dido Sotiriou, who all wrote and published memoirs of events they were close to. The three Syriac authors developed an antagonistic narrative shaped by biblical narrative styles, Christian martyrology and their perception of contemporary events as inter-religious war and traditional Jihad. The non-Syriac authors that have been considered here replaced, in various degrees, this approach by internalization. Greek authors from Asia Minor, such as Venezis or Dido argued, in their narrations, against the ethnic or religious ascription of guilt by emphasizing cases of solidarity between Ottoman Turks (Muslims) and Orthodox Greeks. The two Armenian authors examined here represent a middle position between Syriac moral antagonism and the differentiating introspection of Greek authors. In spite of their very different backgrounds and professions as clergyman and secular journalist, both tried to present their testimonials as documentary, unvarnished and \u201cunliterary\u201d as possible. Is it possible to survive in a system based on violence and terror without the loss of human empathy and dignity? The Syriacs saw this possibility mainly in individual martyrdom. Elias Venezis and Dido Sotiriou, however, named culprits and victims on both sides of the ethno-religious divide and included Muslim rescuers in their narrations. The Armenian authors Yervant Odian and Grigoris Balakian focused their narrations on suffering as such. In the face of their numerous compatriots who had been silenced forever, they cleared their \u201csurvival debts\u201d by writing about the unspeakable and witnessing genocidal destruction.",
