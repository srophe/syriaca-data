    "abstractNote": "The first Scripture for Christians was the Old Testament, which, however, they read in the light of Christ. For them, in disagreement with the Jews themselves, the prophecies of the OT regarding the Messiah were realized in Jesus Christ. In this case, Christians read the OT differently than did Jews, who continued to read the OT according to their tradition while refusing to accept Christ as the Messiah. The Qur\u2019\u0101n, however, accepts that Jesus Christ was al-Mas\u012b\u1e25, but rejects the doctrines of the Trinity and of Christ as the incarnate Son of God the Father. This was, in fact, one of the main differences between the two religions. For their part, Christians, although they did not recognize prophecy in Mu\u1e25ammad, used the Holy Book of Muslims in their different writings, especially as proof-texting for apologetic purposes.",
