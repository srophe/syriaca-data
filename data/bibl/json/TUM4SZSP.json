The first two chapters outline conciliar and post-conciliar teaching. The third discusses the ecclesial situation and evangelization in India, including historical overviews of developments in mission history in India. The fourth chapter is \"Problems and Issues in the Missionary Context of India\", looking at hierarchical intervention to prevent mission from the Syro-Malabar Churches and various perspectives on intercommunion of churches. The closing chapter is on the role and responsibility of the Syro-Malabar church in evangelizing India. With a thirty page bibliography and an index.",
