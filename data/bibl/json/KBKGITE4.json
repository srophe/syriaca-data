    "abstractNote": "In his homilies on baptism, Theodore of Mopsuestia does not use traditional scriptural images such as the flood, the crossing of the Red Sea, circumcision and marriage metaphors to explain the meaning of the sacrament. Instead, the images of the second birth, the death and resurrection with Christ and the adoption of children are employed. In addition, Theodore uses less known image of the refashioning of a broken potter\u2019s vessel. My paper tackles the question of why Theodore does not use some images and why he uses others. To answer this question, I shall demonstrate the influence of Theodore\u2019s doctrine of the Two Ages on his biblical exegesis of the discourse with Nicodemus ('second birth', Jn 3:1-13), the passage on baptism as death and resurrection with Christ (Rom 6:3-5), the narrative of Jesus\u2019 baptism ('adoption of children', Mt 3:13-17) and Jeremiah\u2019s visit to the house of a potter ('refashioning of a vessel', Jr 18:1-6). Indeed, these passages aim to illustrate the Two Ages from different perspectives. The first three passages imply the transfer to the Second Age and the acquisition of the features of divine nature. The last image of the refashioning of a broken vessel alludes to the obtaining of immutability. Theodore does not use the images of the flood, the crossing of the Red Sea and circumcision, because they do not suit his aim, which is to explain the change of the state of human nature in baptism as he himself understands it through the lenses of his doctrine of the Two Ages.",
