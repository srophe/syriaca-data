    "abstractNote": "This paper will present the evidence for two newly discovered words, <i>gawzag </i>and <i>shagar</i>, meaning \u201ctwo-horse chariot/mail coach\u201d and \u201cwagon\u201d respectively in the eastern Arabian dialect of <i>Qa\u1e6dr\u0101y\u012bth </i>(Syriac for \u201cin Qatari\u201d) of the seventh and eighth centuries ce. They reveal the continued local knowledge of wheeled transport in Arabia and possible use long after its supposed disappearance in the Near East between the fourth and sixth centuries according to Richard Bulliet's well-known thesis in his seminal work <i>The Camel and the Wheel</i> (New York: Columbia University Press, 1990). The fact that this vernacular maintained two specific words for two different modes of wheeled transport likely suggests a practical need for them in everyday communication among the inhabitants of the Beth Qa\u1e6draye region (Syriac for \u201cregion of the Qataris\u201d in north-eastern Arabia). Moreover, their use in an Arabic dialect reveals that native words were developed for wheeled vehicles in the local language spoken by the inhabitants of the area well before the adoption of <i>markabah</i> as a neologism to mean chariot in nineteenth-century Arabic, according to Michael Macdonald's stimulating article \u201cWheels in a land of camels\u201d (<i>Arabian Archaeology and Epigraphy</i> 20/2, 2009). Thus, the various rock drawings of two-wheeled carts and chariots in northern Arabia may in fact not only have been known but also used nearby in eastern Arabia, rather than being inaccurate representations reflecting a distant awareness of the existence of chariots elsewhere such as in Mesopotamia and Egypt as had been previously thought. This is a literary, philological. and historical study that aims at presenting newly discovered vocabulary in context for further analysis by linguists and others.",
