    "abstractNote": "The early Christian Passion cycle is examined through textual analysis as well as through the surviving examples from the 4th c. to the iconoclastic period in order to answer the following: When were the various scenes added to the cycle and why? How did the expression of emotion develop and how was it influenced by the written word? The analysis of texts begins with the earliest written accounts on the Passion from the epistles of Paul and the Gospels to the Gnostic and Orthodox writings of the 2nd c. The shift from the use of symbols and types to realism to explain the nature of the mystery of divine revelation is examined. The central theological issue in the development of the cycle is also discussed, that is, the question of suffering and how Christ\u2019s human nature suffered while His divine nature remained impassible. Finally, the evolution of the formation of Holy Week ritual is traced in order to shed light on the question of whether the emergence of the Passion cycle is linked to this development or whether they are perhaps parallel phenomena. The analysis of the art is prefaced with the attempt to address some fundamental issues, such as the disparity between the literary exploration of the theme of the Passion and its artistic expression. Representation of the Passion was absent among the earliest manifestations of Christian art, thus indicating that this theme was not easily approached. The way in which Byzantines thought of and talked about the Passion is also examined to clarify if and when there was a conceptualization of the cycle. Next an attempt is made to understand the changes the cycle underwent over time. Particular emphasis is laid on a defining element of the Passion cycle, that is, the way emotion is represented. This element is especially vivid in the Syro-Palestinian tradition and therefore its contribution and the insights it provides are assessed. The artistic evidence is viewed in parallel with the writings of Ephrem Syrus and Romanos the Melodist in order to thereby gain a full grasp of the importance of emotion to the formation of the Passion cycle. Answers to the question of how the expression of emotion may affect the viewer are gathered from descriptions, epigrams and homilies. Some general conclusions are that whereas fourth-century cycles concentrate on the triumphant message of redemption, which is rendered in a symbolic manner, subsequent cycles begin to focus on themes of suffering and to take on a more realistic, narrative form. The additions of scenes are, on the one hand, linked to the various theological issues of each time period and, on the other hand, to the viewer\u2019s relationship to the image. Finally, the power of Passion images to move the beholder was of vital importance in remembering what Christ did for humanity.",
