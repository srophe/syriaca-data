    "abstractNote": "Isaac of Nineveh lived at a time (7th century) when the East Syrian Church to which he belonged was no longer in communion with the other Christian Churches. Nevertheless his spiritual teachings have, over the centuries, been warmly received throughout the Christian world. Isaac lived at a time when an important reform of monastic life in the East Syrian Church had been carried out under the leadership of Abraham of Kashkar, who sought to eliminate certain excesses. He sought to strike a balance between solitude and community in the life of the monk. Monks were to live alone in hermit-ages, but to come together in the main church for the Saturday night vigil service and the Sunday meal. For Isaac, in line with this tradition, the experience of solitude was the very condition of community life. Discernment was indispensable, if ascetic practice \u2015 either in solitude or in community \u2014was not to become an end in itself, or lose sight of its very goal. The monastic quest must not be pure introspection: a monk is mature for solitude when he is able to live a brotherly life with others. Through solitude he must learn to relate to God, to others and to himself. The goal of solitude is to find compassion \u2014 in charity and communion \u2014 for every creature and for all of creation. This must apply in particular to those who have distanced themselves from truth. True solitude is not self-seeking; it leads neither to judging others nor to bitterness, but to the fulness of charity.",
