    "abstractNote": "Verses 17 to 36 of chapter Maryam state that Hazrat Maryam\u2019s pregnancy made her feel ashamed to face her people. Thus, she took refuge in a distant place to bear the childbirth pain, deliver her child, and avoid facing her people. But God, the almighty, comforted her by giving the good news that the spring will flow at her feet and the palm tree will drop its dates upon her. But apparently the shame of facing the people is not something that can be alleviated by food and drink. Luxenberg tried to make a connection between the two. He believes that the Quran is written in Arabic-Aramaic. And since it has been in a primitive script, without dots and clear signs, some of its words have been corrected, such as \"under\" and \"secret\" in verse 24, where \"Nahit\" means \"delivery.\" And \"shari\" means \"legitimate\" in Syriac-Aramaic. However, historical evidence shows that Muslims were not influenced by the Syriac language in reciting the Qurchr('39')an, and no commentator considers these two words to be written incorrectly. Also, Syriac dictionaries do not confirm the meanings of Luxenberg. In addition, the connection of these verses has other justifications that are more acceptable.",
