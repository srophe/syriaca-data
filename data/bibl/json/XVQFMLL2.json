    "abstractNote": "The subject of this dissertation is The Principles of Religion, a book composed by a Syriac Orthodox monk, Rabban Daniel b. al-\u1e24a\u1e6d\u1e6d\u0101b, in the Arabic language between 1274-89/90 C.E., possibly in Mardin, Turkey. This book has enjoyed some limited circulation over the centuries, having been found in fourteen manuscripts written by scribes in Turkey, Iraq, Syria, Israel, Egypt, and Lebanon from 1289/90 to 1935 C.E. In it, Daniel gives a summary exposition of and apologetic for Syriac Orthodox doctrine using both philosophical and Scriptural resources. The book systematically addresses the topics of God and His attributes, the Holy Trinity, and the incarnation, ending with responses to various objections to Jacobite belief and practice. It is an example of intellectual activity and literary production among Jacobites during the Syriac renaissance that witnesses to how Syriac Orthodox doctrine and literature were adapted and presented in Arabic in the 13th century. The dissertation\u2019s purpose is to present and explain the contents of Daniel b. al-\u1e24a\u1e6d\u1e6d\u0101b\u2019s Principles of Religion by providing a discussion on the book\u2019s authorship, its literary and historical context, its transmission, an English translation, a commentary, and a critical edition.",
