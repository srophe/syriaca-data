    "abstractNote": "This book sheds light on the first three Crusades (1097-1191) by introducing material from several medieval Syriac and Arabic sources and reconciling their accounts with those provided by Western sources. It presents the Crusades as an extension of the conflict between Christianity and Islam, which began with the Arabs\u2019 first incursions into Christian territory in the seventh century and continued with their conquest of the Iberian peninsula. It discusses the evils perpetrated by both sides in the name of religion, and it details the internal struggles that weakened both the Muslims and the European invaders. The book is broad in scope, examining not only the Christians\u2019 efforts to take control of Jerusalem but also relatively minor campaigns against other perceived enemies of the church. It portrays clearly those larger-than-life figures who played major roles in the history of the period, from Pope Urban to Richard the Lion-Hearted and Saladin. Although the Crusades ended centuries ago, the conflict they embodied is still being carried on today, not only in the Middle East but around the globe.",
