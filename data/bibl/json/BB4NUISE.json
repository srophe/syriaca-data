    "abstractNote": "The 17th century monastery of Saint John the Baptist of Hrach\u00a0was the first convent for nuns in Kesrouan. It was custom among\u00a0the Syriac Maronites to have monasteries for religious men and\u00a0women combined. After the Council of Louaiz\u00e9 in 1736 [1] convents and monasteries for monks would become separated. The monastery of Saint John the Baptist of Hrach however, since\u00a0its foundation, was exclusively reserved for nuns. In 17th century Kesrouan, it was also custom for churches and monasteries to be founded by feudal families such as the Khazen\u00a0\n[2]. This was not the case for Saint John the Baptist of Hrach,\u00a0established on land bought by Bishop Joseph of Aqoura in 1642\u00a0[3]. After his election to the patriarchate in 1644, he built the\u00a0monastery on this land and it was inaugurated in 1647. Instead of\u00a0residing in the North at the patriarchal seat of Our Lady of\u00a0\nCannobin, he preferred to settle in the Kesrouan region, which was in full Christian expansion at the time. He made the\u00a0monastery of Saint John the Baptist of Hrach his patriarchal\u00a0residence and resided there until his death in 1648. He even\u00a0convened a Syriac Maronite synod there on December 5, 1644 [4]. From then on, the name of this monastery was intricately\u00a0linked to that of patriarch Joseph Peter of Aqoura or Yaoseph\u00a0Petros Ainqouroyo, as evidenced by the two Syriac inscriptions\u00a0engraved on stone and the numerous documents found in the\u00a0monastery.",
