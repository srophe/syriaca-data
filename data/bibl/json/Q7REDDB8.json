    "abstractNote": "This informative study throws new light on the practice of translation from the Greek originals into Syriac, predominantly during the seventh and eighth centuries, especially on its methods and techniques; moreover, it indicates wider implications for the evolution of Syrian doctrinal theology. The oriental versions of Gregory Nazianzen are in process of publication and have been the subject of some study elsewhere. The choice here of Cyril as corpus vile was therefore good: there is a variety of translated pieces coming from different periods and the development of the Syriac vocabulary of incarnation is interesting and important in itself. The general division of styles between older and freer in contrast with later and more literal is well known. What Dr King usefully does here is to document and analyse more closely the division and contrast. Much incidental information on the technicalities of translation is usefully recycled and an illuminating parallel with the translation of law texts for students is noted. A small point of correction: there can be no doubt that Peter of Callinicus\u2019 Against Damian was written in Greek and translated into Syriac. Style, calques, sentence construction, use of particles, etc. aside, no Pope of Alexandria or Patriarch of Antioch wrote his circular synodical letters in Syriac.",
