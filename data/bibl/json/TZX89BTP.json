    "abstractNote": "In 1916 P.Y. Saeki devoted a page of his book \u201cThe Nestorian Monument in China,\u201d to a short thought experiment which linked a Persian by the name of Li-mi-i \u674e\u5bc6\u7ff3 who was present in Emperor Sh\u014dmu's \u8056\u6b66\u5929\u7687 court and whose arrival was mentioned in the Shoku Nihongi \u7d9a\u65e5\u672c\u7d00 with a priest named on the Nestorian Stele. Since that first suggestion, several scholars have expounded the idea that Li-mi-i and another figure who arrived alongside him, K\u014dho T\u014dch\u014d \u7687\u752b\u6771\u671d, were Christians and/or missionaries. In this paper I assess these claims, returning to the Shoku Nihongi in order to suggest that there is a lack of data to establish them as true. I then seek to explore the origins of this theory situating it within the joint context of Japan's imperial expansion and her modernization. Whilst the latter cannot be conclusive, I hope that it may shed light on the significance of the theory which can be seen as a search to discover Japanese history, a statement of the equality between Japanese and Western histories, or an attempt to justify imperial aims in China academically.",
