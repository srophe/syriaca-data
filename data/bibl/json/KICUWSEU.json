    "abstractNote": "In his ascetic writings a famous East Syriac writer Martyrius-Sahdona pays much attention to the theme of deification of man, due to what he regularly uses the <i>beauty </i>(\u0161upr\u0101) concept. He designates by this word the property of God as well as the property of man, as image of God. In the last case Martyrius understands the beauty as the quality of virtues and as the attribute of the creature in its undamaged state, which is given to it by God. The article attempts to clarify the significance of the concept <i>beauty </i>for the anthropological and ascetic teaching, expressed by Martyrius. Also there is undertaken an attempt to definite a place, which his ideas about the beauty occupy in the context of the works of the Syriac and Greek authors, some of which may have influence on him, and some \u2014 certainly have. After the analysis of the use of this concept in several writings of Martyrius systematic and consistent character of his thought, expressed by this, becomes obvious. In its turn the comparison of assertions about the <i>beauty </i>by Martyrius and by a lot of other authors allows to say, that the teaching of Martyrius about the <i>beauty </i>is consistent with the opinions of these authors, most of which are the Orthodox Holy Fathers.",
