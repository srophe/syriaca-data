    "abstractNote": "There is a great deal of interest in this book, but I am not sure that it will do more than cause renewed reflection on some of the lines of thought advanced by the author.Rosemary Arthur has worked for many years on Dionysios, and this book bears many of the characteristics we have come to expect from her work, especially a boldness in taking up and pursuing ideas that other scholars treat with greater caution. Her conviction of the lateness of the Corpus Areopagiticum (i.e. no earlier than 530) remains, and of the author\u2019s probable dependence on Damascius, the last of the Platonic \u03b4\u03b9\u03ac\u03b4\u03bf\u03c7\u03bf\u03b9 at Athens, who may well have ended up teaching in Syria, though the real influence now is the \u2018Evagrianism\u2019 condemned at the Fifth Ecumenical Council. There is much of interest in her exploration of the Syriac background to Dionysios\u2019 thought, but much that she puts forward seems to me barely proven. Too many of the parallels are isolated, and if Arthur herself can discard evidence (of citation of the Areopagite before the 530s, for instance) on grounds of interpolation, that is a tactic open to others. She is fairly sure that the Areopagite was a Monophysite (at least she does not use the popular barbarism, \u2018miaphysite\u2019), but use of the terminology of \u2018unchanged\u2019 and \u2018unconfused\u2019 does not really distinguish Monophysites from Chalcedonians. She also thinks she has broken the seal of his anonymity, and puts forward Sergius of Reshaina as the author of the works. (If, as Arthur also argues, the author of the corpus was a bishop, then that is something we need to add to Sergius\u2019 CV.) I doubt if this will carry any more conviction than the suggestions others have made (which already include this one). Throughout there is an uneasy balance between general exposition and detailed points. One of these details is the assertion that \u1f51\u03bc\u03bd\u03f5\u03bd does not mean \u2018to praise\u2019, but \u2018to relate\u2019, the evidence being Liddell and Scott. But Liddell and Scott\u2019s lexicon is an authority on classical Greek, not the Greek of Christian late antiquity, and she has overlooked the fact that one of the scholia to the corpus (possibly by Maximos) comments on the Areopagite\u2019s use of \u1f51\u03bc\u03bd\u03f5\u03bd, contrasting it with simple predication (PG 4, col. 328A: on DN 5.8). That seems to me better evidence that \u1f51\u03bc\u03bd\u03f5\u03bd indeed meant \u2018to praise\u2019.",
