    "abstractNote": "The present paper addresses the textual history of the Story of Abraham of Qidun and his niece Mary. It aims at reconstructing the main trajectories of transmission not only of the available Slavic copies, but also of the Greek manuscript tradition. The paper is placed within the framework of the recent project of a digital edition of the Bdinski Sbornik (Ghent University Library, cod. slavicus 408), which envisages a full-scale research into the textual history of all the texts contained in that miscellany. Since within the Slavic manuscript tradition the Story of Abraham and his niece (itself forming only part of the full vita of Abraham) was transmitted primarily within the context of the collection of works of Ephrem the Syrian, known as Paraenesis, the results of this research bear also on issues related to the history of that collection. By analyzing the Slavic and Greek variant readings of just one passage which, however, appears to be key to understanding both the Greek and the Slav text transmission as well as their interrelations, it is shown that the Slavic translation goes back to the most archaic layers of the Greek tradition. At the same time Kodov\u2019s hypothesis of a secondary translation of the Paraenesis may be called into question on the ground of the available textual evidence.",
