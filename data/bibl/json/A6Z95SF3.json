    "abstractNote": "The traditional wedding ceremony with all its phases, as well as ritual attributes was almost completely preserved among the Assyrians in Armenia during the investigated period. Moreover, despite the very close relation with the Armenian traditional culture the Assyrian community kept a number of ethnic cultural characteristics that were obviously included in the wedding ceremony. The comparative description of the Assyrian and Armenian weddings is a proof to it. The bigger role of godfather and negotiator is remarkable, particularly during the process of kespsak, henna, serving wedding ring in a glass of wine, breaking plates in the enterance of bride's house, keeping the virginity sheet and burying it with the baby's shirt which are remains related to more archaic cultural stages. It should be noted that the Assyrian wedding ceremony with its basic phases, process and riual attributes has much in common with the Armenian wedding ceremony. Generally it's a significant component of the Asian Near East cultural heritage.",
