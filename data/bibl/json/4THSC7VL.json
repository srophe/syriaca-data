    "abstractNote": "The aim of the paper is to study the settlement network of the Province Oshroene in the early Byzantine period from a historical geographical, spatially oriented viewpoint. The network consists in the provincial capital Edessa, seven cities and 25 minor settlements. A digital terrain model has been designed in order to support and illustrate the analytical process. An accompanying database of the 33 settlements was also constructed in order to complement the cartographic model and classify the settlements according tohistorical and geographical criteria. The first set of criteria is related to parameters and variables such as the date of foundation, continuous presencein five distinct historical periods, ancient and modern place names. The second set is related to the location of the settlement and uses parameters and variables such as geomorphology, water elements, communication networksand presence of a nodal point. The objects of the paper are the description,analysis and understanding of Edessa and the other settlement and the explanation of their location. The latter is related to site catchment analysis onthe provincial level and enviromental limitations and historical acts in the 6th century. The final goal of the paper is a better comprehension of the historical-geographical landscapes that constituted the Province Oshroene in the early Byzantine period and an improved perception of settlement and communica-tion networks that were formed and transformed by the interaction betweenhuman agents, cultural factors and natural barriers.",
