    "abstractNote": "In the opening lines of the s\u016brah named after the \u201cRomans,\u201d Q R\u016bm 30, the qur\u02be\u0101nic preacher expresses his solidarity with the \u201cRomans\u201d who had then been defeated by the Persian army. In seeking to better understand these verses, one may start with the question: Who exactly are the \u201cRomans\u201d here? \u201cRoman\u201d was a broad, multifaceted term, as Yannis Stouraitis has lately pointed out, based mainly on sources written after the seventh century and stemming from the Greek-speaking \u201cWest\u201d of the Byzantine Empire. In this study, using mainly Syriac sources but also some hitherto unnoticed Greek testimonies coming from the Near East, this semantic variability of the word \u201cRoman\u201d is shown to further expand when going East. Like in most Syriac sources, \u201cRomans\u201d in Q R\u016bm primarily means members of the Byzantine army (and state apparatus), be they ethnic Greeks, Syrians, or Arabs. At the same time, the \u201cRomans\u201d of this s\u016brah are all inhabitants, all \u201ccitizens\u201d of the Byzantine Empire \u2013 not just its armies and magistrates. This latter sense corresponds to the broader sense in which \u201cRomans\u201d is used not only in Syriac, but also in Greek sources (and in other languages of the Late Antique Near East). That broader sense is one that we find in a definition by the Damascene Sophronios of Jerusalem, according to whom \u201cRoman\u201d is anyone \u201cstemming from a city subject to the Romans.\u201d\nAnother qur\u02be\u0101nic passage that refers to the Byzantines (though without naming them), which has very much to do with the same geopolitical context of the Byzantine-Persian wars, Q M\u0101\u02beidah 5:17, seems to criticize a \u201cByzantine\u201d confidence in the invincibility of Christ and Mary. Why does the Qur\u02be\u0101n chose to name the Romans when expressing solidarity with them, yet leave them unnamed when criticizing them? Could it be the case that this difference between naming the \u201cRomans\u201d and leaving them unnamed is somehow meant to show that the solidarity with the \u201cRomans,\u201d as declared expressis verbis in the S\u016brat al-R\u016bm, concerns the entire Byzantine world whereas the sharp criticism in al-M\u0101\u02beidah is not general in the same sense?",
