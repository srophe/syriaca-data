    "abstractNote": "Who was the Jacob of the \u201cJacobites\u201d? For centuries, scholarship on the history of Syriac Christianity has claimed that Jacob Baradaeus was the Jacob of the so-called \u201cJacobite\u201d Christian tradition, known more commonly in recent scholarship as the West Syrian Miaphysite Christian tradition or as the Syriac Orthodox Church, the modern descendant of this tradition. Many scholars have made this claim because they have relied on discourses of heresiology over and, at times, against the evidence of other sources, especially the discourse of West Syrian Miaphysite Christians themselves. Relying on heresiology alone to make this claim has been problematic because heresiology is oppositional and denominal discourse. To understand who the Jacob of the \u201cJacobites\u201d was, this study juxtaposes discourses of heresiology with the discourse of the \u201cJacobites\u201d themselves whom heresiologists opposed and whom they named \u201cJacobites.\u201d This juxtaposition provides a fuller perspective on the Jacob of the \u201cJacobites\u201d and, in fact, reveals another Jacob entirely\u2014the fifth- and sixth-century Syriac poet and theologian, Jacob of Serugh. This Jacob was also significant for West Syrian Miaphysite Christians, but his significance for these Christians has been neglected out of concerns for his alleged \u201corthodoxy.\u201d\nBy re-reading the Jacob of the \u201cJacobites\u201d in the discourse of late antique and medieval heresiologies in juxtaposition with the discourse of the \u201cJacobites\u201d themselves, this study provides a fuller perspective on both Jacob of Serugh and Jacob Baradaeus and, moreover, on the effects of heresiological discourse as to which Jacob was the Jacob of the \u201cJacobites.\u201d",
