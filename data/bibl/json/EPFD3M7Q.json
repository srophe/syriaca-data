    "abstractNote": "Gregory of Nazianzus (d. 390 ce) is known simply as \u201cthe Theologian\u201d in both Western and Eastern Christian communities. Thanks to his rich Greek prose and articulate theological musings, his writings are profound but not necessarily easy, even for native Greek speakers. Among Syriac-heritage Christians, Gregory was highly respected, and his style even emulated, though in Syriac translation. Because Syriac-Christian communities lacked ready access to the works of Homer and much of Classical literature, Gregory\u2019s <i>Orations </i>were particularly important for their role as an access point to pagan learning through a trusted Christian source. Indeed, three remarkable commentaries on Gregory\u2019s <i>Orations </i>have been preserved in Syriac, works that are only now in the process of being translated and published. This study suggests that the CN in Syriac came to resemble something akin to a living \u201cbody\u201d of material, with glosses and commentary that often transcend the boundaries of genre. Manuscripts comprising the highly literal translation of Pawla of Edessa (623-624 ce), replete with neologisms and Greek vocabulary, include paratextual features that were integrated with the text and were passed down with successive manuscript copies. Moreover, the users of these manuscripts also added their own glosses, often reflecting material we find in near-contemporary commentary or <i>\u0161m\u0101h\u0113 </i>(\u201cmasoretic\u201d) manuscripts. In short, those readers who approached the CN in Syriac appear to have brought with them a framework for reading the Theologian that transcended the translation itself. In other words, this medieval Syriac corpus came to resemble what the conveners of this conference have labeled \u201can ever growing \u2018exoskeleton\u2019, which sometimes superseded or even obliterated the actual \u2018body\u2019 on which it was built.\u201d",
