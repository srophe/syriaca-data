    "abstractNote": "The covenants established by the Prophet with the various Christian communities of his time have recently been documented by Dr. John Andrew Morrow in his book <i>The Covenants of the Prophet Muhammad with the Christians of the World</i>. Morrow brought these covenants together from obscure monasteries, collections and out of print books, arguing against the accepted understanding that these are forgeries. The Prophet\u2019s interaction with the Christians of Najr\u0101n is well documented in the Islamic sources, as well as in The Chronicle of Seert, an ecclesiastical history of the Assyrian Church of the East. Yet, no close study of the similarities and differences of the Prophet\u2019s encounter with them has been done, nor comparison of the Islamic sources with what has been related in the Covenant with the Christians of Najran and its Exordium. Doing so provides greater clarity not only in determining the authenticity and authority of the covenants but also in assessing the reliability of the Islamic historical source material. In this paper, a cross-comparison of all the covenants now available is undertaken using source-critical methods. Thereafter, it is argued that categorical dismissal of the covenants as forgeries is no longer tenable. We may then join Charles Upton who, in the Foreword to Morrow\u2019s book, remarked that \u2018we may in fact be witnessing\u2014unexpectedly, miraculously, at this extremely late date\u2014the emergence of a third foundational source for Islam\u2019 after the Qur\u02be\u0101n and the \u1e25ad\u012bth.",
