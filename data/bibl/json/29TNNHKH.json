    "abstractNote": "This dissertation studies a portion of the Commentary on the Psalms by the Syrian author Dionysius Bar Salibi (died 1171). Bar Salibi was a bishop of the Syrian Orthodox Church who played an important role in the final flowering of the Syriac literary and theological tradition known as the Syrian renaissance of the twelfth and thirteenth centuries. His Commentary on the Old Testament is of interest as an example of Christian reception of the Bible in the Syrian Orient and as a source for recovering Patristic interpretation. The commentary is also of interest because it is the only known example of a commentary in which the literal and the spiritual senses of Scripture have been treated separately, in parallel synoptic columns. An earlier dissertation by Marjorie Helen Simpkin (Melbourne, 1974) studied the commentary on Psalms 1-72. The present study establishes the text for the commentary on Psalms 73-82, using nine manuscripts, and provides an annotated translation. After reviewing Bar Salibi's life and works the dissertation surveys previous studies of his biblical commentaries, analyzes his literal and spiritual exegesis, traces his use of Greek and Syriac sources, and discusses his use of the Greek and Syriac biblical versions. Among the most important of Bar Salibi's sources are Athanasius of Alexandria, Daniel of Salah, Moshe bar Kepha, and Ishodad of Merv. <b>The critical Syriac text and English translation of the commentary on Psalms 73-82</b> form the heart of this study. The final section of the dissertation places Bar Salibi's work in a wider, comparative context by comparing Bar Salibi with ancient and medieval commentators on four selected verses: Ps 78:25a (\"the bread of angels\"), Ps 82:1 (\"in the midst of the angels\"), Ps 82:6 (\"you are gods\"), and Ps 82:7 (\"you shall die like men\").",
