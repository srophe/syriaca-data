    "abstractNote": "This paper constructs the theological polemic among Near Eastern Christian sects and the encounter with the new religio-political regional power: Islam. Focusing on the period from around the first Muslim conquests in the mid-seventh century until the ninth centure C. E., a list of East Syriac (Nestorian) Church Fathers and their writings are selected as representative voices in the continuing Christological debates. In particular, the paper is concerned with how theological arguments were first used and reinterpreted to address conversion to Islam and later used to emphasize, in an ironic twist, the proximity between Nestorianism and Islam contra other Christian \u201cheresies\u201d. This historical development is important to understand how Nestorian literature was later used by Muslim theologians well after the ninth century, such as Ibn Ab\u012b \u0162\u0101lib al-Dima\u0161q\u012b in the fourteenth century, to defend Islam and debunk Christianity.\nFor Nestorian apologetics the immediacy of addressing the issue of Christian conversion to Islam was clear. Letters from Nestorian clergy, such as Katholikos \u012a\u0161\u014d\u2019yahb III. (649\u2013659) and Katholikos Georg (661\u2013680/81), recount the old debates among Nestorians, Miaphysites, and Melkites concerning the nature of Christ. In order to explicate best the erroneous attraction of Islam, these two men contextualized Islamic theology as similar to a Christian heretical sect. Yet over time, appealing to Islamic overlordship became necessary. With the rise of the Abbasid caliphate (750\u20131258) and the establishment of its capital in the historical heartland of the Nestorian Church, the polemic was reversed. Hereafter, Nestorian dyophysite doctrine was used as an appeal to the Islamic conception of Christ\u2019s divinity. For example, Katholikos Timotheos I. (780\u2013823) and the theologian Theodor Bar Koni underlined the blasphemy of the Miaphysite and Chalcedonian Christology. This very tactic, however, was easy for Muslim scholars to appropriate in Islamic apologetics. Well before al-Dima\u0161qi, the words of the Abbasid Caliph al-Mahdi to Timotheos are distinct: the Nestorians understood correctly that God could not have suffered and died, but that they all were still wrong that Jesus is the Son of God.",
