    "abstractNote": "The aim of this study is to examine the Christian (Nastorian, Chaldean, Armenian, etc.) migrations that occurred due to the war and terror events that occurred in the Iraq region between 1980-2020 in the context of the concept of migration. The main question of the study is: \"What have been the political, religious, cultural and social dimensions of these migrations?\" A literature review was conducted around this basic question and the data obtained were analyzed. Christians who have lived with Kurds for centuries in both Hakkari (especially Nastorian) and Northern Iraq have been subjected to migration many times in history. In this study, it was found that the Christians who migrated from Hakkari to Iran and then to Iraq in 1915, especially the Nastorians, migrated to European countries with the effect of political instability in the region. These instabilities are: The Iran-Iraq War (1980-1888), the Gulf War, the genocide initiated by Iraqi President Saddam Hussein on the Kurds also affected Christians. In addition, the American invasion of Iraq (2003) and the terror launched by ISIS (Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant) in 2011 are other events that have influenced the migration of Christians. The study data were obtained by taking only the parts related to Christian migration from the works written on Iraq. When the literature on the subject was reviewed, although there was no data on Christian migration in particular, the information in the works that touched on Christian migrations without entering into the content was collected and translated. Both academic platforms and Google browsing did not find studies that only touched on Christian immigration in Iraq after 1980. In this respect, this study was found important in terms of collecting fragmentary data on migration in question and presenting them to the academic field. In addition to the definitions such as refugee, asylum seeker and migrant in the study, these concepts are explained under the theoretical framework title as compulsory and voluntary migrations are also mentioned. In the analysis section, Christian migrations are analyzed in the context of the concepts related to this migration.",
