    "abstractNote": "This paper discusses the semiotics of scripts in a set of Greek, Syriac, and Syriac-Greek inscriptions from the provinces of Roman Syria, suggesting that their scripts open a dialectic through their non-linguistic features, allowing their audiences to engage with the inscriptions as multimedial, communicative objects. In fact, for some, it was the script itself that conveyed the primary meaning, not the text qua language. These scripts-as-images engaged in and reaffirmed generic and institutional expectations in both their local and supra-local contexts. Exploring these dynamics, the chapter examines two data sets as case studies. The first is comprised of Syriac inscriptions that replicate Greco-Roman visual typologies of civic, monumental inscriptions of the late Roman empire. The second set includes the acrostics \u03a7\u039c\u0393 and \u0399\u03a7\u0398\u03a5\u03a3 as well as acclamations from the Christian liturgy that appear in Greek inscriptions. A subset are tituli picti that appear on late Roman amphora produced and shipped from Syria.\nThe central argument is that the choice of script and its use in inscriptions from late antique Roman Syria was itself a communicative act that could express belonging within a community through adhering to a set of norms and expecta-tions associated with a certain stratum of that community, be it civic, religious, or a confluence of the two. The norms and expectations of Christian communities in late antique Roman Syria contributed to the development of a particular epi-graphic habit that was functional in both Greek and Syriac inscriptions.",
