    "abstractNote": "Muslim\u2013Christian relations are as old as Islam. Over the centuries the relationship between the two communities has sometimes been one of enmity, sometimes one of rivalry and competition. But there have also been periods of frank and fruitful dialogue and collaboration and even moments of sincere friendship, which were not overcome by conflicts. This article deals with instances of fruitful dialogue in the first four centuries of Islam when Muslims and Christians engaged in serious theological discussions. A number of factors in the early Abbasid era favored such discussions, such as the cosmopolitan nature of Baghdad and its province, the caliphs\u2019 patronage of scholarship, the emergence of Arabic as a lingua franca and the deployment of dialectical reasoning (<i>kalam</i>). But also, quite simply, there were matters that needed debating. In this article, the author selects three major themes of the theological encounter with the intention of demonstrating how religious ideas were developed over the centuries.",
