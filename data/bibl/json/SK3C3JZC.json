    "abstractNote": "The ancient anaphora of the apostles Mar Addai & Mar Mari is the most  precious apostolic relic of the Assyrian Church of the East. By means of its complex history and rich theological import, it acts as an ecclesial, cultural and liturgical identifier of this same Church. The theological import and beauty of this most ancient anaphora has already been studied in an ample fashion, and recently the PIO and the PUG have celebrated the 10th anniversary of the Roman Document Guidelines for Admission to the Eucharist Between the Chaldean Church and the Assyrian Church of the East (26 October 2001) in October of 2011. This document is a breakthrough in both Eucharistic theology and in ecumenical relations in that, although the Eucharistic Prayer of Addai & Mari does not and never contained the Verba Domini, it is a valid anaphora and an ancient living witness to the faith and Eucharistic praxis of the apostles. These apostles, in particular Ss. Addai & Mari, are foundational for the Assyrian Church of the East. Their history is not simply theological, but their names act as \u2018identifiers\u2019 of the form of Christianity observed and believed by the Assyrian Church of the East. Their names connect important cities of the first evan- gelistic enterprise of the apostles of Christ, namely Ss. Addai & Mari of the Seventy-Two. This anaphora, handed down and faithfully kept by the Assyrian Church of the East, identifies the ancient peoples of this tradition \u2014 the Assyrians \u2014 and has acted as a liturgical and cultural identifier of this Church since its inception in the first century of the Christian era. Today, this anaphora also bears an ecumenical import which is presently and dynamically engaged in conversation with our Sister Churches. This ecumenical aspect carries pastoral issues as well, brought upon the adherents of this Church due to the present religious conflict in the Middle East. The Assyrian Church continues to see movement towards the diaspora, leaving the historic homelands of this faith community more and more vacant. This poses questions of pastoral needs and necessities which are addressed by the 2001 Guidelines, which in turn were prompted by this most ancient anaphora of Christendom still utilized to this very day \u2014 the \u2018Anaphora of the blessed Apostles Mar Addai & Mar Mari, who disciple the East.\u2019",
