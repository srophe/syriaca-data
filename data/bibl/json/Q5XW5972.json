    "abstractNote": "In this chapter, I address how and when church-building became problematic during the early Islamic period in the Syro-Aramaic regions of Northern Syria and Mesopotamia. First, I focus on the evidence provided by ecclesiastical Syriac sources concerning ongoing constructions during the seventh century, when it appears that no legal restrictions operated. Moreover, even under the Marw\u0101nid caliphate, whose social and ideological system was driven by more confessional principles, an impressive number of testimonies suggest an increase in the number of monastery foundations, which may have been a way to shelter private wealth from taxation. Things seem to have changed during the early Abbasid period. The sources are contradictory: some new laws were introduced in Syria against Christian proselytism, but no evidence of such limitations upon church building in the Jaz\u012bra is attested before the 770s. Also, legal evidence and theory suggest that, at least during the first half of the second century AH (720-770), there were two hermetic categories in urban settlements: 1/ the construction of churches was authorized within the indigenous, Aramaic-speaking, mad\u012bnas; 2/ in the am\u1e63\u0101r however, where Arab-Muslims were supposed to hold a privileged position, the very visibility of Christian cult and social habits and practices was gradually banned, especially church-building. Finally, the growing hostility crystallized in traditions that commanded churches in the am\u1e63\u0101r to be destroyed, even if such orders were neither systematic nor effective. The turning point of this story could be the disastrous invasion of Northern Syria by Byzantine general Michael Lakhanodrakon, in 777. Indeed, for the first time in a century, a caliph decided to lead the army in person to repel the enemy in Cilicia, and a significant policy of sunna enforcement and reform was launched by al-Mahd\u012b through a so-called mu\u1e25tasib. Emir \u02bfAl\u012b b. Sulaym\u0101n al-\u02bfAbb\u0101s\u012b was especially committed to this military, as well as ideological, counter-offensive. It struck the Syriac Orthodox church, as recalled by an inscription on the southern wall of the church of E\u1e25nesh, in Northern Syria. After this date of 779-780, the region of the Byzantine frontier, the thugh\u016br, endured a process of military colonization that matches the development of new legal paradigms: the \u201cmi\u1e63rization\u201d of indigenous mad\u012bnas. It consisted in their transformation into mi\u1e63r-like towns or neighborhoods, where the law of the am\u1e63\u0101r was to be applied and \u201cnew churches\u201d had to be destroyed. Gradually, the growing number of Muslim inhabitants in the cities of \u1e24arr\u0101n or Edessa led to their mi\u1e63rization too, if not simply to the downright breach of their treaties (\u1e63ul\u1e25), like in Takr\u012bt and Mosul. At this stage, governors were frequently caught between the antagonistic pressures of Christian and Muslim elites, and also had to face contagious destructing riots staged by Muslim mobs. Every ten years, in ca. 190, 200, 210 and 220 AH, \u201cnew churches\u201d were demolished, and then for the most part reconstructed, a regularity that perhaps reflects a legal principle that has not yet been elucidated.",
