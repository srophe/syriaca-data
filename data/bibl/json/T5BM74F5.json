    "abstractNote": "The Syriac version of 1\u202fMacc. that is preserved in Codex Ambrosianus (7a1) is very different from the one attested in the rest of the manuscripts of the Peshitta. This double attestation is typically explained by a hypothesis first put forward by G. Schmidt in 1897 that sees the version of 7a1 (Syr-2) as a revision of the original Syriac translation (Syr-1), which is the one attested in the majority of the manuscripts. This article aims to challenge this theory. In fact, this study shows that there is no relationship between Syr-1 and Syr-2, that is, Syr-2 cannot be considered a revision of Syr-1 (intended to eliminate additions), but must be understood as a new translation made from the Greek. For its part, Syr-1 is characterised by a number of double readings that could be interpreted as the work of an editor who preserves readings from two different Syriac versions of 1\u202fMacc.",
