    "abstractNote": "From the eighth century through the tenth, the \u2018Abb\u0101sid capital of Baghdad witnessed the translation, in unprecedented numbers, of Greek philosophical, medical, and other scientific texts into Arabic, often via a Syriac intermediary. Muslim and sometimes Christian patrons from all sectors of \u2018Abb\u0101sid high society paid princely sums to small groups of Graeco-Arabic translators, most of whom were Syriac-speaking Christians. In this diverse \u2018Abb\u0101sid milieu, who could claim to own the Greek past? Who could claim to access it legitimately? Who were the Greeks for \u2018Abb\u0101sid intellectuals and how did the monumental effort to translate them make or fail to make the Greek past a part of the \u2018Abb\u0101sid present?\nThis dissertation is divided into three chapters, each investigating a distinct ninth-century approach to accessing the Greek past. Chapter 1 investigates ninth-century narratives attempting to explain how the Greek sciences came to flourish in \u2018Abb\u0101sid Mesopotamia. Against this backdrop, I shed new light on the polymath and patron of translation al-Kind\u012b and his attempts to claim direct access to the Greeks via both an abstract teleology inspired by Aristotle and a concrete genealogy that connected his ancestral tribe of Kinda to the Greeks. In Chapter 2, I analyze other Muslim intellectuals, such as the litterateur al-J\u0101hiz, who radically doubt the ability of Graeco-Arabic translators\u2014the majority of whom, once again, were Christians\u2014to provide such access to the Greek past. I argue that previous commentators on these critiques have missed their subtext, namely the Islamic concept of tahr\u012bf whereby Christians are held to have corrupted the Bible in order to transmit a distorted version of the prophetic past that contradicts God\u2019s ultimate revelation, the Qur\u2019\u0101n. Finally, in Chapter 3, I investigate the attitudes toward translation and the Greek past of the Hunayn circle of Graeco-Arabic translators, who do in fact alter Greek cultural elements in the texts they translate, presenting an idealized version of the Greek past which both Christians and Muslims can claim.",
