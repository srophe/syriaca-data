    "abstractNote": "The establishment of a Syriac Orthodox archdiocese in Guatemala and Central America in 2013 marked the appearance of Syriac Christianity in a context that is linguistically, historically, and ethnically radically different from communities in the Middle East and Western diasporas. These \u201cGuatemalan Syriac Orthodox\u201d are predominantly Maya and former Roman Catholics from mostly poor rural areas, displaying Catholic Charismatic-type practices. This article is concerned with Syriac Orthodoxy as a tradition defined by the Church leadership for the Guatemalan context, which was subsequently adapted in Guatemala through negotiation between the local clergy and lay communities. Through this union, the Syriac Orthodox Church has defined what she considers non-negotiable aspects of her tradition (liturgy, Syriac language, etc.) and, more importantly, she has been able to engage in a dynamic of growth outside the Middle East, India, and her diaspora communities and (re)claim a universal scope grounded in the biblical event of Antioch. This article adopts a pluri-disciplinary approach using field work conducted in Los Angeles and Guatemala in late 2018 as well as sources in Spanish, Arabic, English.",
