    "abstractNote": "\u00abIn the beginning of the sixth century, a powerful Christological controversy arose in the non-Chalcedonian party, while it was being persecuted by the Emperor Justinian. This controversy, which opposed Julian of Halicarnassus and Severus of Antioch, officially dealt with the \"incorruptibility\" of Christ's body during his earthly existence. The actual issue was, in fact, a different conception of the \"sin of nature\" between the two protagonists. Julian did not make any distinction between sin and corruptibility. For him, real human nature was that of Adam before the fall. Corruption was added to it as from outside. The incarnate Word, being unable to sin, was therefore assuming the original nature of Adam, free from any corruption. The emotions and sufferings he endured were not a necessity, but freely accepted. Redemption was to be achieved in a juridical way: the perfect sacrifice of the incorruptible Word of God redeeming humanity from corruption. Severus offered in opposition to it a dynamic and organic soteriology. Most of all, he made a clear distinction between corruption and sin. The corruption inherited from nature is different from the actual sins which humans commit, and which constitute them as sinners. The Word of God was therefore able to assume our corrupted nature, manifested through the \"sinless emotions\", though remaining totally free from sin. He was therefore really consubstantial to our nature, uniting us, through it, to his divinity in order to bestow upon us the grace of divinisation. The importance of this sixth century debate will again come to the fore as the theological dialogue between Roman Catholic and Byzantine Orthodox Churches is expected to deal with the controversial issue of the \"immaculate conception \" of the Virgin Mary.\u00bb (R\u00e9sum\u00e9 du p\u00e9riodique, p. 23)",
