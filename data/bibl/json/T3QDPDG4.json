    "abstractNote": "The project presents and edition and translation of the Syriac version of Epistle CCII of Gregory Nazianzen. This Epistle in Syriac has not been previously edited. The edition was done on the basis of two manuscripts, both held at the British Library: BL Add. 14,549, and BL Add. 14,726. There are no lacunae in the edition, since whatever had deteriorated in one manuscript was legible in the other. The English translation of the Syriac makes evident the ways and extent to which the Syriac version differs from the original Greek Epistle. These differences are also discussed extensively in a commentary which compares the Syriac version with its Greek original. Additionally, other manuscripts which contain Syriac translations of the Epistles of Gregory Nazianzen are discussed, wherein a presentation is made of which Epistles exist in one or more copies, and in which manuscripts. This work shows that at least fifty-three of the Epistles of Gregory Nazianzen have been preserved in Syriac, comprising a significant amount of text. Finally, the translational style of Epistle CCII is analyzed in comparison with the various versions of the Orations in Syriac, demonstrating that Epistle CCII is in many ways different stylistically from those Orations which were revised by Paul of Edessa.",
