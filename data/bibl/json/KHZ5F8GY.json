    "abstractNote": "Scholars have studied in great detail the different units making up the classical anaphoras; however, the fruits of communion unit or \u201ccommunion epiclesis\u201d is one part of the anaphora that has not been systematically studied. While often considered part of the epiclesis, the fruits of communion are their own anaphoral unit that can be seen in eucharistic texts as early as the Didache. This article studies the fruits of communion unit across the classical anaphoras, focusing in particular on this unit in Addai and Mari, <i>Apostolic Tradition </i>4, and the anaphora in the Barcelona Papyrus, as well as the anaphoras of St. Mark, Sarapion of Thmuis, St. Basil, and St. James. Attention is also paid to this unit in other West and East Syrian anaphoras. This unit is highly malleable and can provide important insights into how wide-ranging intercessions began to be included within the Eucharistic prayer. As a result, this article also looks at the absence of anaphoral intercession in early texts like <i>ApTrad</i> and BARC, and argues that in many cases, the anaphoral intercessions were either: 1) expanded from the fruits of communion unit; or 2) were inserted alongside it. Through an analysis of this unit, it is clear that the fruits of communion are the ancient hinge that united the prayers over the Eucharistic meal with the reception of communion and the communicant\u2019s call to continual conversion.",
