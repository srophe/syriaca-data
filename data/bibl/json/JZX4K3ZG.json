    "abstractNote": "The short biblical story of David in Nob received very much attention in the Syriac interpretation, both in east-Syrian and west-Syrian Commentary, and was interpreted in a very unique way. Unlike the Greek and Latin commentators, who preferred to interpret the biblical story through the story of Jesus and his disciples in the grain field, where it is mentioned by Jesus himself, the Syrian commentators interpreted the biblical story directly, being the successors of the Antiochene school, which emphasized the literal and historical meanings in its interpretation of the Bible.\nThe occurrence in Nob, in which David asked for and received from A\u00fcimelech the priest the Showbread, which is permissible to eat only for the priests, received in Syriac Christianity a unique interpretation. This was made possible due to changes in the text already introduced in the translation of the Bible into Syriac, the Peshitta, in the second century AD. In addition to differences in the names of the places, whether intentionally or due to a lack of understanding of Hebrew, a very essential element is different in the Syriac version, namely the abstinence from a woman - which was necessary for eating the holy bread - was replaced by abstinence from a sacrifice. And so the Syrian commentators could link the occurrence in Nob, the centerpiece of which was the bread, to the Eucharist ceremony, as well as to see the persecuted David with his young men as a prefiguration of the persecuted Jesus with his disciples.",
