    "abstractNote": "In this book Dr. Abbas edit the text of Ya\u1e25y\u0101 Ibn \u2018Ad\u012b\u2019 \u00abThe refutation of al Warr\u0101q\u00bb, and  presents Ya\u1e25y\u0101\u2019s theory of unity and trinity showing its philosophical sources and origins particularly depending on The Refutation of al-Warr\u0101q, where Ya\u1e25y\u0101 presented a thorough explanation of this doctrine. The importance of Ya\u1e25y\u0101 Ibn \u2018Ad\u012b\u2019s book, the Refutation of al-Warr\u0101q, lies in its reliance on the logical method in defending the doctrine of Trinity against the accusations of al-Warr\u0101q, for Ya\u1e25y\u0101 has adopted the same logical concepts adopted by his opponent, such as: the substance, the property, and the cause ... to show the reasonableness of what the Christians say: \u00abGod is one substance and three Hypostases\u00bb.\nThe primary objective was to shed the light on the relationship between theology and philosophy according to Ya\u1e25y\u0101 Ibn \u2018Ad\u012b by highlighting the image of Ya\u1e25y\u0101, the philosopher, who adopted the logical philosophical approach to prove the doctrine of Trinity, and employed the philosophical concepts and principles found in the Aristotelian books which he translated or explained forming a philosophical theory on Trinity which intellectually and logically explains the Trinity doctrine of Christians, and philosophically solves the problems raised by this doctrine, among which most notably is: The idea which states that the Father is the cause of the Son and the Spirit, although the substance of the Father, the Son and the Spirit is one; and the issue of the procession of the spirit whether it is from the Father alone or from both the Father and the Son.",
