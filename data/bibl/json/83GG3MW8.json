    "abstractNote": "The basic principle of this project is that the young adults are absent from churches today, especially in the Syriac Orthodox Church (SOC). The church is made of people of every age, and without the young adults the church cannot be whole. This project provides a young adult ministry program that has enabled these young people to become active in the church and grow spiritually. The project grew out of the commitment that I made when I was chosen to be a youth worker.\nThe eight models of spiritual formation created by Arthur David Canales were found to be useful for designing a spiritual formation retreat and four lesson plans for identity that nurtures Syriac spiritual identity in the St. Ephraim congregation in generative ways. This model encourages young adults to intentionally participate in their spiritual journey by engaging in the activity which best suits their own skills, background and interest.",
