    "abstractNote": "The extent of John Chrysostom\u2019s influence on West Syrian Christian exegesis of John is impressive even for an author of such renown, outweighing by far even the impact of Cyril\u2019s commentary on the Fourth Gospel. Perhaps the most striking case of dependence on Chrysostom is a still-unpublished Syriac commentary on John, written by the West Syriac scholar Lazaros of Beth Qandasa (9th century). While in several parts of the commentary dedicated to the first and middle chapters of the Gospel of John Lazaros draws also on several authors other than Chrysostom, as Lucas van Rompay has shown, a look at Lazaros\u2019 commentary on the final chapters (John 19\u201321) shows that his text becomes there a faithful reproduction of Chrysostom\u2019s homilies. However, faithful reproduction was not the only way in which West Syrian authors received Chrysostom. As a comparison with certain passages of the commentaries on John by Moses bar Kepha and Nonnus of Nisibis shows, John Chrysostom was often received by Syriac interpreters in a non-linear way, amalgamated with other exegetical or apocryphal traditions directly or indirectly connected with the Gospel of John, such as the view that Golgatha was the very place where Adam had been buried, or that the wood out of which the cross was made was taken from the \u201ctree\u201d where Abraham had found a ram to sacrifice instead of Isaac. Mapping Chrysostom\u2019s West Syriac reception would not only shed light on how commentators worked with their sources, but also help understand better what made them turn to Chrysostom\u2014rather than to other renowned exegetes\u2014in the first place.",
