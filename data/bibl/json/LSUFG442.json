    "abstractNote": "The biography of Mu\u1e25ammad compiled by Ibn Is\u1e25\u0101q (d. 767) and later written out by Ibn Hi\u0161\u0101m (d. 834) into the <i>S\u012brat Ras\u016bl All\u0101h</i> is the most important testimony to early Muslims\u2019 pious representations of their Prophet. In it, the Christian community in the South Arabian city of Najr\u0101n plays a small but significant role throughout the whole narrative as pre- Islamic monotheists, as zealous and stubborn representatives of Christianity in religious debates, and even as acknowledgers of Islam. Through textual analyses of five sections in the S\u012bra, this article investigates the narrative roles, that the Christian community in Najr\u0101n plays in the <i>S\u012bra </i>and how this peripheral religious group is viewed by the Muslim compilers. It argues that the stories of the Christianization of Najr\u0101n are included in order to frame and give context to the S\u012bra\u2019s later narratives on the interactions between the Christians and the Muslim community in Medina, and that the Christians of Najr\u0101n serve as representatives for Christianity as a whole. At the end of the article, an appendix is included with an annotated close textual and narrative comparison between the S\u012bra\u2019s story of Faymiy\u016bn and \u1e62\u0101li\u1e25 and a Syriac hagiographical work from the 5th century about Paul of Qen\u1e6dos and John of Edessa, which likely was the <i>S\u012bra</i>\u2019s source.",
