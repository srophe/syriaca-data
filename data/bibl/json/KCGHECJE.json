    "abstractNote": "This paper explores the educational practices of the Syriac Antiochene Maronite Catholic Church in the United States towards Maronite children and adults. The paper proposes, to a large extent, that the current educational forms have led to an uncritical obedience to the ecclesial tradition. These forms are: Qurbono (liturgy), catechetical texts, storytelling, and communal modeling. Part one of the paper contextualizes the conversation and describes the four educational forms practiced within the tradition. Part two argues for a refashioning of the educational forms so that they are consistent with a more dialogical and multi-linguistic approach. This is achieved through the practice of being prophetically obedient and placing the current educational practices of the group in direct conversation with prophetic literature. It offers a renewed vision of pedagogy and curriculum for Maronite Religious Education in the United States. The aim is to accompany and guide the Maronite people towards a Prophetic Obedience to this ancient tradition in a revitalized form.",
