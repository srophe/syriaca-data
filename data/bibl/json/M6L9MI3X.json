    "abstractNote": "In this project we train a Transformer-based model from scratch, with the goal of parsing the morphology of Ancient Syriac texts as accurately as possible. Syriac is a low-resource language, only a relatively small training set was available. Therefore, the training set was expanded by adding Biblical Hebrew data to it. Five different experiments were done: the model was trained on Syriac data only, it was trained with mixed Syriac and (un)vocalized Hebrew data, and it was trained first on (un)vocalized Hebrew data and then trained further on Syriac data. The models trained on Hebrew and Syriac data consistently outperform the models trained on Syriac data only. This shows that the differences between Syriac and Hebrew are small enough that it is worth adding Hebrew data to train the model for parsing Syriac morphology. Training models with data from multiple languages is an important trend in NLP, we show that this works well for relatively small datasets of Syriac and Hebrew.",
