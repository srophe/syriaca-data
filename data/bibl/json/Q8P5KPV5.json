    "abstractNote": "The article aims to analyse the writing of the Arabic manuscript Ayasofya 3631 (XIII century) by comparing it with that of others more or less coeval in order to highlight the common characteristics and identify, if not a real school, a current or a handwriting tendency typical of that period. The identification of the peculiarities that distinguish the manuscripts of the same period is important, from the palaeographic point of view, to establish a dating and to study the evolution of Arabic writing as a whole. In some cases, it is necessary to focus attention on minute details, such as for the signs of the ihm\u0101l, whose variety of solutions undergoes changes, albeit minimal, depending on the copyists and historical periods. Moreover, the ihm\u0101l phenomenon highlights, on the one hand, the difficulty of immediately deciphering incomplete writing, on the other, the tendency of Arab scholars and scientists to limit the area of knowledge to a small \u00e9lite. To read these manuscripts, the recipient had to already have a thorough knowledge of the subject and the type of vocabulary, in addition to the language, but also the copyist is required to know what is necessary for his client in order not to incur gross errors. It is not excluded that, in several cases, especially in the medical or scientific field, the two figures coincide or that the copyists are medical students who transcribe their texts for study reasons.",
