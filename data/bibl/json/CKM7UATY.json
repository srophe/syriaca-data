    "abstractNote": "Ethical writings produced by Arabic speaking Christians are intriguing examples of Christian Arabic literature. This article examines a common theme in the ethical works of two select medieval Christian authors who were the members of the Church of the East in the late tenth and early eleventh century, namely Elias of Nisibis (d. 1046) and \u2018Amr ibn Matt\u0101 (ca. 1050). Elias of Nisibis\u2019 <i>Kit\u0101b Daf\u2019 al-Hamm</i> (The Book of Elimination of Grief) is written to provide a scheme of dealing with unwanted anxiety. The first chapter of this book is entitled as \u2018The Merit of Godliness and the Defect of Impiety\u2019. In this part, he depicts the essence of devoutness as \u2018fear of God\u2019 and explains its ben- efits in detail to achieve a virtuous life. \u2018Amr ibn Matt\u0101 is the author of the voluminous theological encyclopaedia called <i>Kit\u0101b al Majdal</i> (The Book of Tower). The fourth chapter of the <i>Kit\u0101b al-Majdal</i> is divided into seven subsections, each of which deals with a certain spiritual or moral practice. The first section of the fourth chapter in this work is entitled \u2018al-taqw\u0101\u2019 (piety/fear of God) where the author describes \u2018fear of God\u2019 as the compulsory element of moral development.\nConsidering both the Islamic intellectual setting and the Christian backgrounds of the authors and focusing on the different aspects of the texts including linguistic features, sources, and possible audiences, this article examines how \u2018fear of God\u2019 is explained in these two medieval Christian Arabic writings. The conclusion reached at the end is that both authors creatively employed the traditional Christian sources and Islamic material to encourage their fellow religionists to lead a virtuous life essentially motivated by the \u2018fear of God\u2019.",
