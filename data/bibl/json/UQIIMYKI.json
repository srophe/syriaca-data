    "abstractNote": "The article deals with the L.R. Kyzlasov\u2019s archive on the 1954 excavation of the Christian church with the cemetery (Site IV) at the Settlement of Ak-Beshim, as well as with the archaeological report of V.I. Kozenkova who was a student of the Department of archaeology of the Moscow State University and the head of excavation at the Site IV. She conducted a study of this site under Kyzlasov\u2019s guidance. Studying of Kyzlasov\u2019s and Kozenkova\u2019s field reports, the author revealed that the Christian church was built in two stages. The central room and the yard were built at first, and a side room was attached in the second construction period. Near the east wall of the altar room, at fl oor level, there was the altar platform intended for the priest and the altar. Similar churches are known in Uzbekistan: the Urgut monastery of the 8th \u2013 early 13th centuries and churches of the 9th \u2013 11th centuries at the Ak-Beshim Settlement. The first Christian burials appeared under the walls of the church during its functioning, while the others graves are dated back to the period of its desolation and abandonment. For the territory of Central Asia so far, the only case of burial of the dead under the walls of the church building.",
