    "abstractNote": "Kurdish has been written in many different scripts throughout history. One of these alphabets is the Syriac alphabet. The texts written with this alphabet are called Kurdish Garshuni texts. David Barzane (D\u0101w\u00edd Barezn\u0101y\u0101) was a 19th-century Chaldean Church clergyman and poet. The autograph manuscript containing his poems in Classical Syriac, Neo-Aramaic and Kurdish is preserved in the Collection of Syriac Manuscripts of the Dominicans of Mosul. One of the two Kurdish Garshuni poems in this manuscript has already been published with transcription and translation. In this article, another unpublished poem is transcribed and translated. However, by focusing on the literary and cultural interaction between the Christians who speak Neo-Aramaic and the Kurds, it is to be drawn attention to the close relationship between the forms of poetry and style of performance in both traditions.",
