    "abstractNote": "The history of Christianity in the Gulf is still largely unknown since both archaeological and written sources are sparse. Many questions remain about the development and disappearance of Christian communities, as well as their form. A few sites were identified as Christian because of the discovery of churches or crosses. A church was excavated at al-Qusur (Failaka Island, Kuwait) by the French Mission to Kuwait in 1988\u20131989. Since 2011, a new French\u2013Kuwaiti Archaeological Mission in Failaka (MAFKF) has aimed to better understand the site\u2019s phasing and organisation. The discovery of a large refectory and a small tripartite building that is most probably a monk\u2019s cell, as well as the reinterpretation of a church-like building as a structure perhaps dedicated to the spiritual education of monks has demonstrated that at least the central part was a monastery, making it the second Christian settlement in the Gulf to be proven to be a monastery.",
