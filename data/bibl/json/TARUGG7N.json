    "abstractNote": "The thesis explores the available evidence for the life and works of a Christian monastic author \u0160em\u02bf\u014dn d-\u1e6caib\u016bt\u0113h who was active in the region of south-west Iran during the 7th century. He must have belonged to the intellectual movement present within the monasticism of the Eastern Church, along with another representative of the same tradition, Isaac of Nineveh, with whom he may have even been personally acquainted. However, what makes the case of the literary heritage of \u0160em\u02bf\u014dn d-\u1e6caib\u016bt\u0113h special is his binary profile. On the one hand, he was an intellectual monk deeply rooted in Antiochene theology and mystical asceticism closely linked to the Greek monastic and patristic tradition. On the other hand, he appears to be known (particularly by the later tradition) as a physician whose works were available to Medieval Islamic medical scholars and, through that channel, even reached Europe in Latin disguise. This somewhat contradictory picture was accepted by some modern scholars given the fact that the two components that we find united in \u0160em\u02bf\u014dn d-\u1e6caib\u016bt\u0113h, namely intellectual monasticism and medical science, were indeed of central significance for the Eastern Church during that period. In other words, \u0160em\u02bf\u014dn d-\u1e6caib\u016bt\u0113h is often depicted as a monk-scholar of the type that, according to scholarship, must have existed in the Eastern Church. A closer look into the matter allows us to ascertain that this picture is somewhat incorrect and should be updated.",
