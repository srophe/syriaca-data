    "abstractNote": "The <i>Testamentum Domini</i> (TD) is a collection of liturgical and canonical materials cast as the prescriptions of the Lord given to his disciples in a post-resurrection dialogue. Extant in Syriac, Ethiopic, and Arabic, it contains a large collection of texts prescribing times of daily prayer for some of the clergy of the church: the bishop, presbyter and widow. The TD provides the presbyters with a prayer to be said daily, and the widows are provided with prayers to be used at night and at dawn. In addition, the TD prescribes prayer at fixed hours of the day for the laity. Although unique to the TD, these texts have not been analyzed in their entirety by a Western scholar. The purpose of the study is to analyze the forms of daily prayer prescribed in the document using a comparative liturgiological methodology, in order to correctly place them within the larger history of ancient Christian daily prayer. The study analyzes the prayers prescribed for the presbyter and widow, and highlights ascetic terminology employed in them. Because the daily prayer guidelines for the widow, presbyter, and bishop occur within larger literary contexts of ascetic prescriptions, the study approaches daily prayer in the TD as an element of a larger complex of ascetic practices performed by the widow, presbyter, and bishop. The study suggests that behind the TD daily prayer materials and the ascetic rules in which they occur stand ascetic traditions which may have existed as an independent source. The study also concludes that the TD interprets the ecclesiastical widow, presbyter, and bishop in terms of the ascetic traditions it has utilized.",
