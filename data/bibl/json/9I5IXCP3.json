    "abstractNote": "The Syriac poetry of the 11th\u201314th centuries (so-called Syriac Renaissance) was studied very purely until quite recently. One of the reasons for such indifference is a traditional approach of the scholars, who treated this poetry as a secondary one, because of a strong influence of the Islamic literature. In this article, it is argued that the authors of this period were trying to connect their own poetical traditions with the achievements of the Persian and Arabic poetry. As the result, they created new original forms that need to be carefully examined. One of the creators of this new style was probably Bar \u02bfEbr\u014dy\u014d (1226\u20131286), a famous West-Syrian philosopher and scientist. His esthetic approach was developed by his East-Syrian contemporary Kh\u0101m\u012bs bar Qarda\u1e25\u0113 of Arbela, who used sophisticated rhythmic and rhyme schemes to achieve a stronger expressive effect. The article discusses one of his poems that demonstrates his outstanding skills as a poet experimentalist in both rhythm and rhyming.",
