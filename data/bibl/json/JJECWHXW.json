    "abstractNote": "The impetus for this study was the seeming lack of interest in Tel Masos as the site of a potential second East Syrian monastery in Palestine. Upon closer examination, the monastery's ascription as East Syrian was cast into doubt and a broader investigation began. It became clear that the monastery at Tel Masos had fallen into a void between academic disciplines. Geographically, the site falls within the discipline of Byzantine and early Islamic archaeology in Palestine, while theologically it belongs in the field of Syrian Christianity. Since the publication of the site, no one had taken the opportunity to bring the site into a dialogue wherein both facets, geographical and theological, were engaged. The main goal for this study was to start such a conversation.",
