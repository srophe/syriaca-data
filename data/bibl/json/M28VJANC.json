    "abstractNote": "Am\u012bn al-Dawla Ibn al-Tilm\u012bdh (d. 1165) was born in Baghdad into a family of Christian physicians. He served several Abbasid caliphs, who entrusted him with high-ranking positions, such as that of \u2018head of physicians\u2019 of his hometown. He wrote about twenty books and treatises, including a renowned dispensatory. In this chapter I examine Ibn al-Tilm\u012bdh\u2019s little-known work on simple drugs, the Kit\u0101b quw\u0101 l-adwiyah (Book on the Faculties of Simple Drugs). The text consists of 287 entries on medicinal plants, minerals, and a few animal products. Each entry is divided into five sections, dedicated respectively to synonyms, descriptions, \u2018faculties\u2019, benefits of the simple drug, and its use in compound remedies. The most interesting of these sections is the first, as Ibn al-Tilm\u012bdh not only gave the usual Arabic names of plants and minerals and their synonyms there, but also regularly listed the Syriac, Persian, and Greek names of the drugs.",
