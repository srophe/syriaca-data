    "abstractNote": "In recent years, a number of Iraqi intellectuals have participated in a discourse on pluralism in Iraq that includes a call to address the traumatic collective experiences of the country\u2019s ethno-religious minorities. Such a confrontation with the \u201cwounded memory\u201d of these minority groups \u2013 along with a rewriting of the modern history of Iraq to incorporate their stories \u2013 would be an important step in creating a new collective memory, one of cultural pluralism, that could lead to a true coexistence among all Iraqis. Since it is very difficult to carry out this process due to deep sectarian divisions within Iraqi society, literature provides an alternative cultural field for the deconstruction and reformulation of existing \u201cmaster narratives\u201d. The purpose of the article is to examine literary representations of the \u201cwounded memory\u201d of minorities in Iraq. The examples used here are related to the 1915\u20131916 Armenian genocide in the former Ottoman Empire and the 1933 massacre of Assyrians in the northern Iraqi village of Simele. They can be found in the following novels written in Arabic by Iraqi authors of Christian origin: A\u1e6d-\u1e6cuy\u016br al-\u2018amy\u0101\u2019 (The Blind Birds, 2016) by Layl\u0101 Qa\u1e63r\u0101n\u012b, Saw\u0101q\u012b al-qul\u016bb (The Streams of Hearts, 2005) by In\u2018\u0101m Ka\u01e7a\u01e7\u012b, \u2018Ir\u0101q\u012b f\u012b B\u0101r\u012bs: s\u012bra \u1e0f\u0101tiyya riw\u0101\u2019iyya (An Iraqi in Paris: An Autobiographical Novel, 2005) by \u1e62am\u016b\u2018\u012bl \u0160am\u2018\u016bn, and F\u012b inti\u1e93\u0101r Fara\u01e7 All\u0101h al-Qahh\u0101r (Waiting for Farag Allah al-Qahhar, 2006) by Sa\u2018d\u012b al-M\u0101li\u1e25. This article is divided into three sections. An introduction is devoted to the aforementioned discourse. The second and solely descriptive section consists of three subsections focusing on literary characters who experience and/ or witness the tragic events and/or tell others about them. The third section contains concluding remarks and refers to several concepts formulated by researchers in cultural memory studies.",
