    "abstractNote": "Prior to the sixteenth century, the Assyrian communities of Hakkari were hardly an important part of the Church of the East which, at that time, was a successful missionary institution strongly rooted in the urban centres of Mesopotamia and Persia. With the subsequent emergence, however, of the Hakkari highlands as the Church\u2019s main stronghold, and the home of its sole Patriarchate, the region\u2019s inhabitants additionally began to increase their significance and dominance in its ecclesiastical organisation, literary output and scribal activity. This was more successfully achieved after the traditionalist Patriarchate of Alqosh united with the Chaldean Catholic Church in 1830, severing the reliance of many Hakkari villages upon that major centre. Nevertheless, as isolated and inconsequential as it had been in its earlier history, the Hakkari region produced some of the most interesting and prolific writers of not only the Church of the East, but also the Syriac world as a whole. These were people who penned treatises and discourses, wrote letters, and composed superb metrical homilies of exquisite quality, as well as vital relevance to the ecclesiastical and spiritual corpus not only of the Church of the East, but also of other Christian denominations. This paper will explore the most well-known Assyrian writers and theologians from Hakkari, from Sahdona of Halmon in the seventh century to Rabban Yonan of Tkhuma (died 1886), briefly detailing what little is known of their lives, achievements and literary works, as well as their historical and cultural significance.",
