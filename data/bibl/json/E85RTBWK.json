    "abstractNote": "Alessandro Mengozzi\nPublished Online: 2017-11-14 | DOI: https://doi.org/10.1515/olzg-2017-0117\nLicensed Access\nDownload PDF\n\nBruno Poizat, former professor of mathematics at the University of Lyon, traveler in the Middle East, fluent speaker of Neo-Aramaic as a foreign language and teacher of Sureth at INALCO, publishes in this book a manuscript by Jacques Rh\u00e9tor\u00e9 that he found some years ago in the archives of the Dominicans of Saulchoir (Paris) and an updated catalogue of modern critical editions and manuscript collections of Sureth texts. In the convenient form of a volume of the Subsidia series, he thus adds a precious source of data, information and critical reflection to the two anthologies of Sureth religious poems published in the series Scriptores Syri of CSCO, voll. 589\u201390 and 627\u20138.\n\nThe first part of the volume (pp. 1\u201377) is an accurate edition of the uncompleted and so far unpublished work La versification en Soureth by French Dominican Jacques Rh\u00e9tor\u00e9 (1841\u20131921). The second part (79\u2013141) contains most valuable information on Sureth literature, with updated bibliography, and a detailed and very informative commentary on Rh\u00e9tor\u00e9\u2018s text by the editor.\n\nA missionary from 1874 in Mosul and in the mountainous region between Van and Mosul, Rh\u00e9tor\u00e9 wrote grammars of Armenian and two varieties of Neo-Aramaic: \u1e6c\u016br\u014dyo \u2013 also called \u1e62\u016brayt, a cluster of Neo-Aramaic dialects spoken in \u1e6c\u016br \u02bbAbd\u012bn, south-eastern Turkey \u2013 and Sureth, an autoglottonym used, among other names \u2013 (Modern) Aramaic, Assyrian, (Modern) Syriac, Vernacular Syriac\u2013, for North-Eastern Neo-Aramaic varieties that were and are spoken and occasionally written by Christians of various denominations\u2013especially Assyrians, Chaldeans and Syrian Catholics \u2013 in northern Iraq, south-eastern Turkey, Syria and north-western Iran.\n\nFather Rh\u00e9tor\u00e9 collected and studied manuscripts of Sureth religious poems and in the second part of the volume Poizat gives a detailed description (95\u20139) of ten items that are now kept in the library of the Dominicans of Mosul, recently rescued from IS violence by their heroic Superior, Father Michaeel Najeeb. In continuity of ideas with Rh\u00e9tor\u00e9, Father Najeeb has spent and is spending much time and energies in a project of digitization of books and manuscripts belonging to the Iraqi Dominicans and to other private and public Christian libraries of the plain of Mosul. In 2014, he moved the library of the Dominican Friars of Mosul (DFM) from Qaraqosh to Erbil. A provisional description of the manuscripts of this collection is now available in the online database of the Hill Museum & Manuscript Library (HMML) at Saint John's Abbey and University in Collegeville, Minnesota (www.hmml.org).\n\nRh\u00e9tor\u00e9 realized the cultural importance of the traditional stanzaic poems among the Aramaic-speaking Christians and their potential as pastoral tools for the Catholic missionaries, who in the 19th century were particularly active and successful in bringing the native Christians of the plain of Mosul to union with Rome and what they held as orthodox theology. They also introduced devotional practices of contemporary European Catholicism in northern Iraq.\n\nIn this work \u2013 that Poizat faithfully reproduces in print, including the author's erasures, corrections, old-fashioned spellings and secondary additions\u2013, Father Rh\u00e9tor\u00e9 shows he is aware of the social function of poetry among native Syrians: poetry serves for liturgical and pedagogical purposes and it is required on certain special occasions in their public life. He therefore writes this ars poetica as a tutorial for missionaries, who may themselves compose verses, precisely as he did. Indeed, with the pseudonym Yaqo Nukhraya (Jacques l'\u00c9tranger) or Yaqo bar Qushta (Jacques le V\u00e9ridique), Rh\u00e9tor\u00e9 composed fables in verse, songs and hymns, sometimes with the assistance of the famous native poet and bard David the Blind. On the basis of the HMML database, a number of Sureth works by Rh\u00e9tor\u00e9 can be added to Poizat's list (84\u20136): the translation of a number of books associated with devotional practices, dated 1877 (Confraternitas SS. Nominis Jesu, DFM 95; Militiae Angelicae seu cinguli Sancti Thomae Aquinatis, DFM 96; Via Crucis, DFM 344); The Life of St. Blaise, Martyr and Bishop of Sebaste, in prose (DFM 132, 1879); and the bilingual \u2013 French and Sureth \u2013 La Montagnarde Chald\u00e9enne et l'Ange, \u201con the social, political, religious, and moral situation of the Church of the East\u201d, with notes (DFM 346).\n\nLa Versification en Soureth is divided into a prologue and ten chapters. The first (Notions g\u00e9n\u00e9rales sur la po\u00ebsie soureth) and ninth (D\u00e9fauts et qualit\u00e9s des versificateurs soureth) chapters are more critical in nature and reveal Rh\u00e9tor\u00e9's attitude towards Sureth poetry and the society of which it is a typical cultural expression. According to Rh\u00e9tor\u00e9, despite their religious inspiration and their roots in late Classical Syriac hymnography, Sureth poems represent a simple and primitive form of folk poetry, which is cultivated by and for uneducated, often illiterate, peasants and herders. Rh\u00e9tor\u00e9 recognizes the oral context in which Sureth poems were produced and transmitted, the subordination of metrics to music, the circulation and success of texts thanks to roaming bards like David the Blind, Thomas Sindjari, and Elias of Tchamba, who travelled from village to village to sing fables, songs and hymns and collect food and money for their families. Nevertheless, as a 19th\u2013century scholar, he is not methodologically equipped to appreciate the aesthetics of repetition and rhythm and the formulaic features of oral literature in the vernacular, while he criticizes the abuse of poetic license and of Arabic and Kurdish words, the prolixity and bad taste of Sureth poets.\n\nChapters 2 to 7 are more technical in nature: they explain and exemplify the structure of feet, rhymes (the manuscript DFM 235 preserves a list of rhyming words by Rh\u00e9tor\u00e9), caesurae and stanzas. The eighth chapter is an anthology of excerpts of various genres and meters, while the ninth chapter is a gold mine of bio-bibliographical information on Sureth poets whose lives and works would otherwise be barely known. Among other additions and up-dating, Poizat's notes help identify the manuscript sources and provide a French translation of the excerpts included by Rh\u00e9tor\u00e9 in his anthology, adding precious bibliographical and factual information on Sureth poets.",
