    "abstractNote": "This work aims to provide a linguistic analysis of the Garshuni language attested in MS. Jerusalem, Monastery of St. Mark 199 (1732-1733). Garshuni refers to the Arabic language written in Syriac script starting as early as 12th century to modern time. Garshuni language is part of the larger term \u201cMiddle Arabic\u201d which has its own issues in term of history and linguistic aspects. Focusing on the Syntactical issues in this manuscript, the study looked at what is seen as deviation from Classical Arabic by Arab grammarians as part of the linguistic development. Despite the work has been done on Middle Arabic to date, no linguistic analysis has been conducted on Garshuni. We lack scholarly studies of individual Garshuni text that could help us had better understand how this variety of Middle Arabic fits into the history of Arabic language more broadly. My method in this work is to analyze over 120 pages of the manuscript and more than 430 cases by comparing them with Classical Arabic, other Semitic languages, and Modern Arabic dialects. The findings provide some different answers to the Middle Arabic deviations, which normally accused by pseudo-corrections. Although pseudo-correction was the main reason of the deviation in some cases, there is a great amount of cases has equivalent usage in Classical Arabic or Modern Arabic dialects or sometimes both. Thus, this work, with the new findings, adds to the field of Arabic language history another approach by analyzing more Middle Arabic texts instead of look at them as a lower level of Arabic.",
