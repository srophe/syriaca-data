    "abstractNote": "Encratism (from \u03b5\u03b3\u03ba\u03c1\u03b1\u03c4\u03b5\u03b9\u03b1, self-control) existed within the Christian movement from its earliest days. Encratites characteristically rejected marriage, especially sexual relations; the eating of meat; and the drinking of wine. Any, or all, of these, according to Encratitic teaching, brought condemnation. Although the early church generally favored the ascetic life, the Encratites demanded it. Behind the rigid asceticism of the Encratites was a weltanschauung which held that this creation is essentially evil. Encratism achieved considerable popularity and influence during the first centuries of the existence of the church. This study discusses Encratism from the first through the fourth centuries. Part I, comprising chapters 1 and 2, describes (1) the Hellenistic cultural context which encouraged asceticism generally, and (2) Jewish sectarian asceticism which provided specific ante- cendents for Encratism. Part II, comprising chapters 3 through 8, describes the character of Encratism as seen through the eyes of both the Encratites themselves and their opponents. Chapter 3 discusses Encratism in churches of the New Testament period; chapters 4-6 describe the Encratism which was so important in Syriac Christianity; and chapters 7 and 8 discuss the Encratite movement in Egypt, North Africa, and Asia Minor. The dissertation is based upon primary sources such as the writings of the church fathers, extant Encratitic literature, (including Encratitic compositions found at Nag Hammadi), and the canonical New Testament. The writings of various scholars who have investigated Encratism and its influence within early Christianity have also been consulted.",
