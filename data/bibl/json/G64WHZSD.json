    "abstractNote": "The Psalms of Solomon are Jewish pseudepigraphical material from the late first century, B.C.E. surviving in eleven Greek and five Syriac texts dating from the eight to the sixteenth centuries C.E. They were included in the table of contents in the fifth century C.E. Codex Alexandrinus and continued to be copied and preserved and are important today for the light they shed on the historical and theological situation in the first century C.E. The focus of this dissertation is the demonstration of the probability of a Hebrew Vorlage behind both the Greek and the Syriac texts. Until recently, the scholarly consensus was that the Psalms were originally composed in Hebrew, translated into Greek and then into Syriac. Recently, there have been suggestions that both the Greek and the Syriac are translations of Hebrew and this dissertation in a thorough examination and comparison of the Greek and Syriac texts demonstrates a high degree of probability for this theory. Following the introduction and discussion of methodology (Chapter One) the bulk of the dissertation is a detailed examination of the eighteen psalms (Chapter Two) with a proposed Hebrew Vorlage and translation for the passages where the differences between the Greek and Syriac texts provides the clues for the original language. The conclusion (Chapter Three) also has some implications for further research in the Psalms of Solomon and other similar literature.",
