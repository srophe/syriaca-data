    "abstractNote": "The aim of the present paper is to introduce new data concerning the polemic that took place in the VIII century C.E. and was related to the mystical movement in the Church of the East. This data are provided by an anonymous commentary on \u00abChapters on the Knowledge \u00bb which belong to rabban Aphn\u012bm\u0101ran, an 7th century mystical writer. Among the problems the aforementioned polemic was related to, was the question on whether the humanity of Christ can see His divinity. For the positive answer on this question, John of Daly\u0101th\u0101, a prominent mystical writer of the 8th century, was condemned by Catholicos Timatheos. In the commentary on the 90th chapter of rabban Aphn\u012bm\u0101ran, an anonymous interpreter claims that the vision of God is the knowledge of God. As rabban Aphn\u012bm\u0101ran calls the human nature of Christ \u00abknowing\u00bb (yadd\u016b\u0295t\u0101n\u0101), the humanity of Christ inevitably knows His divinity, the author of the commentary concludes. In the present article, the text of this commentary is published and analyzed. One may see that the thesis on Jesus\u2019 ability to contemplate the divine nature was not a particular opinion of John of Daly\u0101th\u0101. This opinion was representative of East Syriac mystical movement (or at least of one of monastic traditions within this movement).",
