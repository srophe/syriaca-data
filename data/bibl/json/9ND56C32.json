    "abstractNote": "The \u201cUpper Monastery\u201d at Mosul was an important centre of liturgical development and reform of the Assyrian Church of the East. There, the liturgical book called \u1e25\u016b\u1e0fr\u0101 received its form as it is presently known. After a discussion of the genesis of the \u1e25\u016b\u1e0fr\u0101 in general, this paper examines fragments found in Turfan, China, which provide valuable insights into the spiritual and liturgical richness that shaped the Rite of the Assyrian Church of East. These fragments are particularly noteworthy in light of Anton Baumstark\u2019s assumption that mission stations far from the place of origin (such as Turfan) tend to preserve older customs. Therefore, an exploration of these fragments will allow for a fuller understanding and appreciation of this rite and its development.",
