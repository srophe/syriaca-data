    "abstractNote": "The Glossary by the Arab author Bar Bahlul of the 10th century, the Gospel of Tigranakert and the copy of the inscription of the church Mardin prove the existence of Syro-Armenian script. D. Margoliute had devoted an article to the Glossary in 1898 which aroused great interest among armenologists. H. Tashian examining the questions connected with the manuscript writing mainly focused on the issue of transliteration. Nevertheless the question of the Armenian dialect, in which the manuscript is written, has not definite answer in D. Margoliut\u2019s and H. Tashyan\u2019s articles. H. Acharyan assumes that it is written in a dialect very close to the one of Tigranakert. We consider that it is the dialect of Edessa, as there are specific grammatical features of this dialect as a definite article with the use of nouns and present tense form in verbal structures. Referring to the inscription, H. Tashian has not accepted that it was written in 450, because the date also in Syriac letters and the stone from which it was copied is missing. The existence of Tigranakert Gospel accidentally became known in 1914, but after a short time it disappeared. It is supposed to be destroyed in 1915-1916 during the massacres of Syrian Christians. D. Margoliut suggests that nothing has been written about the Syro-Armenian manuscripts for many years as they have been kept secret. The data stored about these manuscripts and inscription allow us to say that after the creation of the Armenian alphabet by Mesrop Mashtots the Syro-Armenian script in Armenian Mesopotamia was gradually put out of use and manuscripts, as the Gospel of Tigranakert proves, were kept secret by Syrian priests.",
