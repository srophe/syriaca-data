    "abstractNote": "This article traces a conflict that erupted in the late 19th century between the Armenians and the S\u00fcryani. This conflict, I argue, precipitated nothing less than the creation of the S\u00fcryani community itself. The dispute began over the key to a closet in the Church of the Holy Sepulchre, but it quickly evolved. Soon, the Armenians and the S\u00fcryani were clashing over holy places all around Jerusalem. The dispute centered on an Ottoman administrative arrangement which had been institutionalized nearly 400 years earlier: yamakl\u0131k. The Ottoman investigators, however, were unfamiliar with this archaic arrangement and had to be reeducated as to its terms and its history. The S\u00fcryani and the Armenians offered divergent accounts. Where the Armenians furnished hard documentation, however, the S\u00fcryani could produce only claims to tradition and local practice. In this article I argue that, through this protracted conflict, the S\u00fcryani came to understand the importance of the documentary record in a post-Tanzimat Ottoman world. They thus turned to an alternative strategy that would conform to this documentary sensibility and render their community visible to the state: a series of petitions with thousands of S\u00fcryani signatures from around the Ottoman Empire.",
