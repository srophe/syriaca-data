    "abstractNote": "The <i>Third Syriac Consultation</i> of the Syriac Dialogue between the different Churches of the Syriac traditions took place at Mundelein near Chicago, Illinois, in July 1997. One of the main topics of the Consultation concerned the person and the teaching of Theodore of Mopsuestia, who died in 428, before the great Christological controversy between Alexandria and Antioch broke out.\nCyril of Alexandria had succeeded in condemning his rival Nestorius at the Council of Ephesus in 431. Soon afterwards Cyril\u2019s supporters in Syria and Egypt started a campaign against the Antiochene \u2018forerunners\u2019 of Nestorius. Especially Theodore of Mopsuestia was accused of being the \u2018father of Nestorianism\u2019, but Cyril decided not to condemn Theodore officially. In the meantime Theodore\u2019s writings had begun to circulate in Syriac translations in the Church of the East in the Sasanian Empire.\nIt would last until the reign of the Emperor Justinian (527-565) that the issue was reopened. Theodore Askidas, Justinian\u2019s theological advisor, started a deadly attack on Theodore of Mopsuestia who in his eyes should by all means be condemned officially by the Church. Because of the inconsistent attitude of the Roman Pope Vigilius, Justinian convoked a council at Constantinople in 553. The programme of the Council had been carefully drawn up by Askidas and Justinian and the issue of the Council was clear from its start: Theodore of Mopsuestia was to be condemned as the \u2018father of Nestorianism\u2019, even given the fact that he had passed away 125 years ago. No real discussion took place about Theodore\u2019s theological background and Theodore\u2019s real vision on the person of Christ. In the Church of the East Theodore lives on as the great \u2018interpreter\u2019 of Scripture.",
