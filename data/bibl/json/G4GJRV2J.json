    "abstractNote": "This paper is an attempt to sketch the movements of Syrian and Palestinian populations within and towards the Byzantine Empire in the seventh century. However, due to the limitations of space it is not possible to explore all the aspects of such a complicated and multifaceted phenomenon. Additionally, this paper does not aspire to provide a full list of all individuals or groups that migrated in this period. Thus, it will focus mainly on the movements linked with the Persian and the Arab conquests of the Levant as well as the Italian campaign of Constans ii. The paper will seek to trace population movement by examining both textual and archeological evidence from the seventh century, and it will attempt to overcome the scarcity of the sources by bringing parallels from later periods. In order to gain a complete understanding, the text will also examine population movements within and towards the Caliphate, and will compare the population management policies of the two rival states.",
