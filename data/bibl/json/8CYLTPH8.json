    "abstractNote": "Although some thorough studies have been conducted in regard to the three versions (the LXX, the Peshitta, and the Targum) of Hebrew Proverbs since J. A. Dathe\u2019s remark in 1764 about the resemblance between the Peshitta Proverbs (P) and the Targum (T), the renderings of the versions have not been investigated for certain features of the Hebrew text. This study is an attempt for the following goals: (1) to examine the three versions in relation to the verb (qtl/yqtl), Kethibh/Qere, and repeated verses in the Hebrew text, (2) to classify deviations according to their kinds, (3) to present agreements among the versions against the Hebrew text, and (4) to investigate the dependence among the versions. In rendering Hebrew qtl and yqtl forms, the participle is often used in the LXX when two verbs occur close. The yqtl forms preceded by negative \u2018\u2018al\u2019 are rendered in two ways: negative + aor. subj. or negative + pres. impv. T exhibits a mixed use of two prefixes for the imperfect, \u2018nun\u2019 and \u2018yod.\u2019 This is due to the translator\u2019s linguistic background as well as the influence of P. The variation in spelling also reflects the influence of P on T. In rendering many repeated Hebrew verses, the LXX is the most inconsistent. Of deviations, the LXX contains many misreadings and additions. Some deviations are due to the frequent use of fixed expressions. T contains many grammatically unnatural forms and scribal/copyist\u2019s errors. These seem to have resulted from imitating Syriac forms. Against the MT, there are abundant agreements in following categories: LXX = P = T, LXX = P, P = T. But almost no agreements are found between the LXX and T (LXX = T). Mixed features are found in P and T, which can be symbolized in the following ways: P = LXX + MT, T = P + MT. The direction of the dependence among the versions is evidently: LXX /to P /to T.",
