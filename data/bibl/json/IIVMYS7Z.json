    "abstractNote": "This article examines the parallel conceptualizations of \u201creligion\u201d developed by two intellectuals of distinct backgrounds in late Sasanian Iran, Burz\u014dy and Paul the Persian, and the broader climate of incipient \u201csecularity\u201d their ideas, and the convergence between them, may reflect. The article shows how these authors made similar innovations within their respective religious and scholarly traditions (Zoroastrianism for Burz\u014dy, specifically the genre of <i>andarz </i>or wisdom literature; East Syrian Christianity for Paul the Persian, along with late antique Neoplatonism), significantly breaking with their antecedents and contemporaries. Both Burz\u014dy and Paul delineate a certain sphere of discourse, focused above all on questions of cosmology, eschatology, and the otherworldly consequences of action in this world, in which the members of various \u201ctraditions\u201d or \u201creligions\u201d participate. These authors also share the assumption that the choice between these traditions or religions should be made on the basis of reason, and not tradition, and they are also each, in their way, emphatically noncommittal to any individual tradition or religion. Aspects of Burz\u014dy and Paul the Persian\u2019s shared late Sasanian context, including the popularity of the interreligious disputation, are brought forth to explain their parallel departures from tradition. The transmission and reception of these authors\u2019 respective works and ideas in the medieval Islamic world are also considered, along with the broader intellectual legacy of the Sasanian Empire.",
