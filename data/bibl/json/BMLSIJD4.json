    "abstractNote": "Two religions traditionally considered missionary faiths originated among Semitic people, Christianity and Islam. They have one thing in common: belief in One God who is just, merciful, omnipotent and omniscient, and who acts in history. In accepting prophecy and Jesus as Messiah, Islam thereby elevates his mother Mary to a special role and position. Among the Qur'anic revelations communicated by the angel appears Mary the mother of Jesus. It is this Mary, mother of Jesus the Messiah, that will be the focal point of this study. After delineating a general background and the limitations of this study (Introduction), the pre-Christian goddesses and the Woman of the Book of Revelation are discussed (Chapter 1). A background is given (Chapter 2) of Christianity as it existed before and at the emergence of Islam, with special emphasis on Mary in the Syriac tradition, a tradition which reaches its height in the Hymns of St. Ephraem. Mary is presented according to the Qur'an (Surah 3), and the exegetes (Chapter 4) \u2013 including Fatimah \u2013 comparing the texts with those of the Bible and the Christian sources. Similarities and differences are presented (Chapter 5), bringing into relief the questions of (a) religion and language \u2013 paganization, Judaization, Christianization, and Islamization \u2013 and, (b) of faith and origin. This study is intended, then, to compare and shed light, with the hope of bringing to the arduous ecumenical journey an atmosphere of understanding and peace.",
