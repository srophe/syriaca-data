    "abstractNote": "We have only begun to scratch the surface of the Cilician Armenian translation movement, especially in the case of translations from Syriac texts. Even the Armenian reception of authors as highly appreciated as Ephrem and Jacob has received relatively little attention in non-Armenian scholarly circles, aside from a few rare exceptions. An investigation into the manuscript evidence is promising for the future of Syro-Armenian studies. It demonstrates a great interest in Jacob and his writings among the Armenians, starting in the twelfth century at the latest, all the way until the nineteenth century, when manuscripts with translations of Jacob\u2019s homilies were still being copied. Furthermore, a particularly important step in the Armenian reception of Jacob was the integration of a Life of Jacob into the Armenian synaxarion by Gregory of Khlat around the turn of the fifteenth century.\nSeventeen Armenian translations of homilies by Jacob have been identified so far, eight others are not extant in Syriac. The task of identifying, editing, translating and studying these texts will be a long-term process. At the moment, we even lack a basic understanding of the way in which these texts were translated. A comparison of the incipits suggests that many are fairly literal translations, but some texts were translated rather freely. Only a more detailed study will confirm these preliminary observations. It may be that certain texts were translated more than once (double translations), that there are retranslations or that translations were reworked or abbreviated.",
