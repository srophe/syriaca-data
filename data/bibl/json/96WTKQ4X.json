This article offers a survey of these texts with a view to introducing them as promising source material to scholars outside the subfield of Eastern Christian legal studies. The article\u2019s goal is to examine text-critical and structural matters, as well as the question of the law books\u2019 sources, in order to arrive at an understanding of the texts\u2019 nature as historical documents \u2013 in other words, an understanding of how and to what purpose they were composed. From this perspective, the article argues that both works are essentially redacted collections of individual rulings; in the unified form of law books, they were intended to represent an authoritative communal law for East Syrian Christians. In issuing these rulings the patriarchs drew from a range of earlier Syriac legal texts to address matters of ecclesiastical law, but to create a confessional civil law they adopted and adapted a variety of common Near Eastern legal institutions and practices.The Syriac law books of the East Syrian patriarchs Timothy I (r. 780-823) and I\u0161\u014d' bar N\u016bn (r. 823-828), published by Eduard Sachau in 1908, are rich but underutilized sources for the intellectual and social history of the late antique and early Islamic Near East.
