    "abstractNote": "The Syrohexapla (Syh) is widely believed to be a faithful witness to the Hexapla of Origen. This Syriac version was produced in the seventh century on the basis of Greek texts related to Origen's six-columned masterpiece of biblical scholarship. In Syh are preserved the signs used by Origen in the Hexapla to mark the divergences between the Greek and Hebrew texts, and also the readings of several Greek Jewish versions which are no longer fully extant. This thesis evaluates Syh as a witness to these hexaplaric materials in III Kingdoms (I Kings). Each of the nearly 600 signs preserved in Syh is analysed. They are divided among correctly marked asterisks, correctly marked obeli, and inaccurately marked readings. The 333 readings attributed to the Greek Jewish versions are treated separately. Finally, by including a chapter which examines a portion of the many readings in Syh for which no hexaplaric sign has been preserved, we are able to balance our sanguinity when considering the reliability of Syh for studying the remains of Origen's Hexapla. The number of materials preserved in our version compared with the number preserved in other witnesses is striking. In this study, we discover that no other witness compares to Syh as a trident of the hexaplaric tradition. However, the Conclusion argues that the textual scholar must use Syh with a cautious optimism: while our version is the best witness to the hexaplaric tradition that we possess, it is by no means a flawless one. This thesis prepares the way for a new critical edition of the hexaplaric fragments of III Kingdoms, which is now possible due to the results of the present study. Ultimately, this material will allow us to learn more about the interactions between Jews and Christians in the Graeco-Roman and Late Antique periods, their understandings of the nature of Scripture, and the methods they used to make the Divine Word understandable.",
