    "abstractNote": "This dissertation is a social history of the Patriarchate of Antioch during the Fourth, Fifth, and Sixth centuries. The Patriarchate was the administrative unit which comprised the modern states of Syria, Lebanon, Jordan, and part of southern Turkey. One of the most striking features of the administration of the Church was its adaptation of Hellenic culture and institutions. Hellenic culture joined religion and politics in such a way that many of the city's characteristic systems of organization and fellowship were equally connected with religion and politics. Hellenic culture thus provided access for the Church to the bureaucratic and social patterns of the Greco-Roman state.\nThe Acts of the Apostles describes the early proslytization effort among the Gentiles. Antioch, with its strong Hellenic acculturation, was the center of this activity. The Hellenic educational system of Antioch, its class structure, and its cults and patronage networks all provided organizational paradigms for the Church. These institutions created the necessary bonds among members of the urban community for the construction of a Church government. The patronage networks, for example, helped the Church to build its own patterns of authority, and provided a basis for the establishment of bonds of obligation and responsibility within the community.\nThis study is also concerned with how traditional Greco-Roman political policies persisted in the external relations of the Patriarchate. The relations between the Patriarchate and the Arab tribes, for example, continued in many respects the administrative norms of the Roman Empire. Internal administration also proceeded along lines set up by the Greco-Roman bureaucracy. There were some ethnic and national bases for the heresies. Some of these trends influenced the internal politics of the Patriarchate as well as the development of its institutions. In summary, this study shows how the administration of the Greco-Roman Empire was continued by the Church, through the characteristic institutions of the city.",
