    "abstractNote": "The present dissertation is an investigation of the extant MS material representing Arabic versions, translated from Peshitta, of the Book of Ruth. Seven Arabic MSS, ranging from the 13th to the 17th century, are investigated and classified according to their origins. Five of the MSS represent one Syriac-Arabic version, probably of Egyptian provenance, a free translation from Peshitta, whereas the other two MSS, both of which written in Damascus in Melchite circles, represent another version, a literal translation from Peshitta. These two Syriac-Arabic versions are presented in separate editions, in which one of the MSS of each version is chosen as its basic MS and the readings of the other MSS are given in the apparatuses. This classification and text edition of the MSS is combined with an extensive investigation of the language of these texts. The MSS are not written in pure Classical Arabic. Early Neo-Arabic elements from the vernaculars of the copyists are mixed with the attempted Classical Arabic in these Middle Arabic texts. The linguistic investigation of the MSS is presented in grammar form, in three sections: (1) Orthography and phonetics, (2) Morphology, and (3) Syntax. Here the Neo-Arabic phenomena of the MSS are presented in contrast to Classical Arabic.",
