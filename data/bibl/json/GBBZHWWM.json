    "abstractNote": "The Ottoman Genocides wiped out a significant portion of the Assyrian population native to the Tur Abdin region of Southeast Turkey. For these Assyrians and their descendants, the genocide known as Seyfo represents a pivotal moment in collective cultural history and memory. Decades after the killings, beginning in the 1960s, mass migration prompted by political and economic dissatisfaction led to another drastic decline in the Assyrian population of Tur Abdin. With this exit of Assyrians out of their ancestral lands emerged a transnational boom in cultural production, specifically in music reflecting on life in exile and the memories of one\u2019s homeland.\nSung primarily in the Turoyo language, the music from this period is characterized by lyrical and acoustic components that express seemingly conflicting memories of both suffering and resistance. Focusing on the musicians\u2019 native villages, these songs lament the brutalities of the Seyfo and also pay homage to its resistors or gabore\u2014\u201cheroes\u201d\u2014more than half a century later. A similar dichotomy emerges when examining oral testimony from Seyfo survivors and their descendants. The following paper discusses the narratives depicted by these oral histories, assessing what they reveal about collective trauma, the construction of memory and the socio-political situation of Assyrians in Turkey.",
