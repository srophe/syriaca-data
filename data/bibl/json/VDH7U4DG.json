    "abstractNote": "The most ancient evidence of the Maronite office is the manuscript named Vatican Syriac 59 used for the funeral of the bishops, the priests and the deacons. This thesis suggests a complete translation and a liturgical and theological study of this office. The liturgical study reveals the general organization of this ritual office, set on the places of priest's deaths, which involve some extracts of hymn from the Bible and which are arranged into 24 events. The theological study let us find out some concepts, symbols and proper figures belonging to the Maronite eschatology. Whilt talking about traditional subjects of Christian eschatology like death, human destiny, Resurrection, judgment, scheol, and so on, however, this differ by a particularly approach linked to the biblical and semitic mentality. On that way, the funeral office is typical of the theology and the spirituality belonging to the Antiochus Syrian Maronite Church. However, while examining the sources of this theology we have noticed an influence of the Hellenistic thinking which appears in a dualistic vision of the human being and his destiny. Some hymns give a portrait, probably idealistic, of the Maronite Church priests, an inventory of the acts of their ministry and also an evocation of their pastoral relations with their churches. This research has been done in connection with the movement of back to the liturgical and historical sources which has been requested by the Synod of the Bishops for Lebanon in 1997.",
