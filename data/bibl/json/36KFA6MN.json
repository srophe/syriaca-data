    "abstractNote": "This article analyzes two sets of late antique witnesses to the Abgar-Jesus correspondence: the discussion of the letters in the literary record of the 4th-6th centuries and the Coptic version of the correspondence, as preserved in amulets and ritual formularies. I approach each of these sets with a particular interest in how the texts\u2019 forms-both the textual variants contained within them and the physical objects upon which they are inscribed-may reflect practices of engagement with the letters, drawing attention to the ways in which ancient readers, scribes, and ritual specialists grappled with questions about these texts\u2019 source, attribution, stability, and reliability. The available evidence suggests that ancient readers, hearers, and users of the Abgar-Jesus correspondence were not particularly concerned with questions of \u201ccanonical authority\u201d and \u201cgenuineness;\u201d these texts were put to use not because they were demonstrably \u201cauthentic,\u201d but because they worked. While a number of features suggest the letters\u2019 origins as part of an \u201cepistolary fiction,\u201d these texts were nevertheless received as efficacious in matters of life and death. Their utility for particular scriptural practices trouble the modern distinctions between \u201cauthentic\u201d and \u201cforged,\u201d \u201creal\u201d and \u201cfictional,\u201d \u201ccanonical\u201d and \u201capocryphal,\u201d and demand a recalibration (if not total overhaul) of these analytical categories as applied to antiquity.",
