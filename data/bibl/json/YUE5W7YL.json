    "abstractNote": "<i>Problem</i>. The dilemma of the Syriac version is its mysterious provenance and the direct relationship it may have to the other versions (particularly G and CJ). Thus some scholars have automatically discarded or ignored the Peshitta version as a useful tool (as a textual witness) for the study of the Hebrew text. The knowledge of textual problems, in this case the relationship of Peshitta to the ancient versions, is of extreme importance in the analysis and study of the Hebrew Bible. The awareness of G, CJ, and M employed in the textual composition of Peshitta will help in exegetic, semantic, and linguistic studies of the Old Testament.\n<i>Method</i>. Critical editions of the OT with their apparatus constitute the basic database for this study. This work consists of a comparative, analytic, and evaluative study of the Peshitta version of Ezekiel in relationship to the ancient versions (G, and CJ) and to M. The study covers the first twelve chapters of Ezekiel, but only those readings in the Peshitta that indicate a probable relationship to an external source are taken into consideration.\n<i>Conclusion</i>. Peshitta (Ezek 1-12) was based on a Hebrew text similar to that of M, and any relationship to another ancient version can be explained as a mere coincidence or by the use of a common translation technique. In this case Peshitta is useful as a tool in textual criticism of the Hebrew Bible, for it is a valuable witness to a Hebrew consonantal text very similar to M.",
