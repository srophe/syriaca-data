    "abstractNote": "The purpose of this dissertation is to clarify the doctrine of new creation in the theology of John Wesley. And the basic assumption that guides my inquiry is that there can be a new hermeneutical clue--a transformative, dynamic teleology of re-creation--which helps to re-read Wesley\u2019s theology. According to this re-reading, Wesley views the true nature of Christian religion as the restoration of the image and likeness of God. This larger scheme overcomes the tendency toward an individualistic reading of salvation that results from an interpretation of Wesley based on the ordo salutis. After clarifying the centrality of a dynamic teleology, the implications for Wesley\u2019s religious epistemology are discussed. Seen in this wider context, the \u2018spiritual senses\u2019 function as a medium through which we grasp the true revelation of God\u2019s love. Whether obscured or lost because of the Fall, these new senses are awakened by the Spirit of God in the new birth. But the final goal of this spiritual apprehension is the perfection of our potential in terms of the entire renewal and sanctification in the image and likeness of God. Finally, the historical sources of Wesley\u2019s dynamic teleology of new creation are investigated. Foremost for this inquiry is his reading of the Macarian homilies that reflect the early Syriac tradition. Against Outler\u2019s opinion that Gregory of Nyssa is the prime influence on Wesley\u2019s concept of perfection (teleiosis), this dissertation argues that Macarius and the Syriac tradition deserve proper recognition as a major source for what is distinctive in Wesley\u2019s understanding of perfection, sanctification, and the spiritual senses. In the theology of Macarius, we find a great many parallels to Wesley\u2019s teleological orientation that enables us to regard it as a presupposed substructure for the Wesleyan synthesis. As a result, Wesley\u2019s theology is connected to primitive Christianity through the ancient Syriac tradition.",
