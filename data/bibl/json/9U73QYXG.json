    "abstractNote": "The poems published and studied here \u2013 most of them for the first time \u2013 represent literary tastes of East Syriac educated circles of the Ottoman period. These text collections appeared as later additions in the manuscripts written by \u02bfAbd\u012b\u0161\u014d\u02bf of G\u0101zart\u0101, the Uniate East Syriac Church poet and the second patriarch (1555-1570). These small texts, usually having very little or even nothing to do with the main manuscript text, represent a kind of verse notes made by different pilgrims, and reflect popular poetic tastes of the period. Short poems, especially quatrains, are an ideal form for such poetic activities. Judging from their great number, the spread of short poems was constantly increasing since the time the Syriac Renaissance, when they were first borrowed from Arabic and Persian poetry. Apparently, the multi-lingual poems of the Mongol period (second half of the 13th-early 14th century) \u2013 the heyday of the Syriac tradition in the Islamic period \u2013 were treated as appropriate models to portray contemporary cultural life of the multi-lingual Christian communities in the Ottoman Empire.",
