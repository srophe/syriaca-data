    "abstractNote": "As Christians and Muslims encountered each other in the Middle East from the beginning of Islam in the 7th century CE onward, theology was not only a field of setting boundaries to distinguish one\u2019s own community from the other but also an area of mutual influence between the communities. This article analyzes two letters of the East Syriac patriarch Timothy I (d. 823), both of which have an apologetic agenda but at the same time demonstrate Timothy\u2019s familiarity with the Muslim intellectual milieu of his day. To defend the Christian doctrine of the Trinity against Muslim objections, Timothy made reference to the Islamic doctrine of divine attributes. He used relational attributes which consist of a subject, an act, and an object to show that there must be a certain plurality as well as relationships between the subjects, acts, and objects of the divine attributes. These relationships serve Timothy as a proof for the Christian doctrine of the Trinity. In this article, Timothy\u2019s arguments and the teachings he ascribed to his Muslim counterparts are compared with what modern scholars have reconstructed about the teachings of Muslim thinkers from Timothy\u2019s period; so far, such comparisons have been done for Christian Arabic writings more commonly than for Syriac ones. The result of this comparison shows that the positions of Timothy\u2019s Muslim counterparts approximate very closely the ideas of the Mu\u02bftazilite Ab\u016b l-Hudhayl al-\u02bfAll\u0101f. Thus, based on their content, it is possible to connect Timothy\u2019s letters to the teachings of a concrete person among Muslim intellectuals of the period or to circles where Ab\u016b l-Hudhayl al-\u02bfAll\u0101f seems to have been somehow involved.",
