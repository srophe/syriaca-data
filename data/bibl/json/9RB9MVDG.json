    "abstractNote": "This chapter explores the longstanding significance of prophet and saint shrines in Islamic lands through a study of the creation, transformation, and expansion of three shrines in Mosul and northern Iraq: the mosque or Mashhad of Prophet Jonah, the mausoleum and monastery of Mar Behnam, and the synagogue and tomb of Prophet Nahum. Because Mosul, like many parts of the late medieval Middle East, had a large non-Muslim population whose holy places were revered by local Muslims and non-Muslim communities, prophet and saint shrines occupied a unique place. Often grounded in natural settings and marking places where a saintly figure was believed to be present or buried. They had been the object of support from multiple donors and continually rebuilt. By the early modern period, many became large, semi-independent holy places catering to various populations and purposes. Welcoming outside visitors who stayed for long periods of time and places where manuscripts and relics were stored, they fulfilled the joint function of living and confessional space. At the same time, many, like the prophets and saints they honoured, were found on or near sites with long histories of curative powers. while the administration of each frequently changed, their ecumenical appeal did not.",
