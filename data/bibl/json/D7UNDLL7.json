    "abstractNote": "In the sixteenth century, interest arose in Europe for Syriac, the literary and liturgical language of Eastern Christians. Those who were interested in the Syriac could count on the help of Levantines, usually ecclesiastics, who came to visit mainly to establish relations with the Church of Rome. Among them Moses of Mardin, who visited Rome between 1549 and 1553, then went to Vienna (1553-1556), and finally, after a sojourn in his homeland and in Egypt, was in Rome again from 1577 to 1592. The article deals with the activity of Moses as a teacher of Syriac, based on first-hand documents: the exchange of letters with Andreas Masius (nine letters, dated to 1553, 1555 and 1556) and the teaching tools employed by Moses: Syriac books he owned, dictionaries he wrote, and notes dating back to his last stay in Rome, when from 1581 to 1585 he was a teacher of Arabic and Syriac at the College of Neophytes (MS Vat. Syr. 229). From the correspondence it appears that Masius has recourse to the help of Moses for his translation from Syriac into Latin of the Anaphora of Saint Basil, published in 1569. Moses corrects wrong readings, explains words unknown to Masius, clarifies aspects of the Syriac liturgy. During his stay in Vienna Moses also compiled two Syriac vocabularies, for Johannes Widmanstetter and for Masius. Masius recognizes in his translations from Syriac, and in his Syriac grammar, the debt towards Moses of Mardin, referring to him as \u201edoctor meus Mardenus\u201c. The manuscript Vat. Syr. 229 contains notes from Moses: numerous linguistic notes, on words from the Gospels, and another outline of a vocabulary. The linguistic notes are dedicated to phonetic issues, or to teaching the correct pronunciation of Syriac.",
