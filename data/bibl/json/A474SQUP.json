    "abstractNote": "The article is devoted to identifying the features of the development of Christianity in Iraq for almost two thousand years, from the emergence of the first Christian communities in the 1st century AD. The authors pay special attention to the modern period: from the beginning of the formation of the independent Iraqi state in 1914 to the present. The paper critically analyzes the primary sources of information \u2014 first of all, the materials of the population censuses, as well as statistical data collected by religious and ethnic organizations in Iraq, and NGOs affiliated with them.The authors examine the history of the formation of the Christian community in Iraq, the establishment and development of the country\u2019s most important churches, dwell in detail on their structure and draw conclusions about their modern spread. It was revealed that the number of Christians for most of the 20th century was characterized by relative stability and amounted to about 3-5% of the country\u2019s population, beginning to decline rapidly after 2003, due to the events of the American occupation and the civil war, which led to the fact that 90% of Christians in Iraq had left their homeland by 2022. The article determines that by the time of the formation of Iraq, 85% of Christians lived in the north of the country; by 1957 their territorial redistribution took place in the southern direction \u2014 mainly to the metropolitan region. At the beginning of the 21st century, in territorial terms, the Christian community of Iraq actually returned a century ago. Fleeing from extremists, Christians migrated to the northern regions of the country and now 83% of them are concentrated in the Nineveh\nPlain and in Iraqi Kurdistan.",
