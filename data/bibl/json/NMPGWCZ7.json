    "abstractNote": "Ephrem the Syrian (ca. 306-373 CE) was perhaps the most influential Father of Syriac-speaking Christianity. Chapter 2 of the Syriac commentary on Daniel ascribed to him is investigated in this paper: The biblical (Peshitta) text the author probably had at his disposal when he wrote the commentary, similarities and differences between the commentary and Ephrem\u2019s interpretation of Daniel 2 as it is found in hymns known to have been written by him, and the way in which the text of Daniel 2 was interpreted for Syriac-speaking Christianity in this commentary. A comparison is also made between the exegesis found in the commentary and that of Ephrem\u2019s older contemporary, Aphrahat the Persian Sage. The commentary is found to contain ideas very similar to that of Ephrem, so that it is possible that he or someone from his school of thought could have written it.",
