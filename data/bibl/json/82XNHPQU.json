    "abstractNote": "The famous Armenian myth about St. Hakob Mtsbnetsi (also known as Saint Jacob of Nisibis, or Saint James of Nisibis), introduced into the literary circulation by Faustus of Byzantium in the 5th c. AD, appeared to be widespread in the narratives on Armenia and Mount Ararat in the travel notes of European travellers. The narrative about St. Hakob\u2019s climbing up to the Noah\u2019s Ark and returning with its particle, is narrated in the travel notes by foreign travellers Rubruck, Saint-Quentin, Mandeville, Newbury, Cartwright, La Boule-Le Guz, Chardin, Lucas, Tournefort, Gardane, Ker Porter, Dubois de Monperreux, Parrot, Kotzebue, Thielmann, Belanger and others.\nAs a rule, the travellers\u2019 notes are mainly composed of the same elements: in separate travel notes, only their correlation changes. From the general arsenal of traditional formula-motives, the narrator chooses one or another version, depending on individual addictions and used sources (written or oral). However, in a number of travelogues (Kotzebue, Thielmann, Belanger), one can see St. Hakob\u2019s replacement by Gregory the Illuminator. The thing is that the particle of the Noah\u2019s Ark granted to St. Hakob by the Lord, was transferred from St. Hakob Monastery to Ayrivank, and from there to Etchmiadzin.\nIn connection with its location, it became necessary to create a new myth. Narrating the story of St. Hakob\u2019s climbing Ararat, the clergy of Etchmiadzin Monastery began to link it to Etchmiadzin. Thereby, however, the process of mythmaking did not cease: the aquisition of the relic kept in Etchmiadzin began to be considered the merit of St. Gregory, whose name was associated with the construction of the Cathedral shortly after the conversion of the Armenians to Christianity in the place where Christ had descended from heaven in the saint\u2019s vision. The substitution of St. Hakob by St. Gregory was designed to complement the substantial logical succession: Ararat \u2013 Gregory the Illuminator, the founder of the monastery \u2013 the Etchmiadzin Monastery \u2013 the relic preserved in the monastery.",
