    "abstractNote": "An industrial city on the outskirts of Stockholm, S\u00f6dert\u00e4lje is the global capital of the Syriac Orthodox Christian diaspora, an ethnic and religious minority group fleeing persecution and discrimination in the Middle East. Since the 1960s, this Syriac community has transformed the standardized welfare state spaces of the city\u2019s neighborhoods into its own \u201cMesopot\u00e4lje,\u201d defined by houses with Mediterranean and other international influences, a major soccer stadium, and massive churches and social clubs. Such projects have challenged principles of Swedish utopian architecture and planning that explicitly emphasized the erasure of difference. In The Construction of Equality, Jennifer Mack shows how Syriac-instigated architectural projects and spatial practices have altered the city\u2019s built environment \u201cfrom below,\u201d offering a fresh perspective on segregation in the European modernist suburbs.\nCombining architectural, urban, and ethnographic tools through archival research, site work, participant observation (among residents, designers, and planners), and interviews, Mack provides a unique take on urban development, social change, and the immigrant experience in Europe over a fifty-year period. Her book shows how the transformation of space at the urban scale\u2014the creation and evolution of commercial and social districts, for example\u2014operates through the slow accumulation of architectural projects. As Mack demonstrates, these developments are not merely the result of the grassroots social practices usually attributed to immigrants but instead are officially approved through dialogues between residents and design professionals: accredited architects, urban planners, and civic bureaucrats. Mack attends to the tensions between the \u201cenclavization\u201d practices of a historically persecuted minority group, the integration policies of the Swedish welfare state and its planners, and European nativism.",
