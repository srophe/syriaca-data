    "abstractNote": "This study sets forth a new examination of the translation technique evident in Peshitta Zechariah. The study defines translation technique as the translator's process of decision-making employed in the translation project. The most fundamental aspect of this translation technique is the translator's default method of rendering the source text into the target language. The translator of Peshitta Zechariah segments the text at the level of the phrase, renders the translation at the level of the word, and values the meaning a word conveys over the specific word and form employed. The translator's default rendering characterizes the majority of the translation, and Peshitta Zechariah, in this regard, is largely within the tradition of the translation of the Peshitta as a whole.\nA second aspect of the translation technique involves cases in which the translator deviates from the default method of rendering the text in order to achieve overarching translational goals. The translator of Peshitta Zechariah has four translational goals: to create a domesticated translation, to create a clear translation, to create a text that is internally consistent, and to simplify complex semantics or grammar. In order to achieve these translational goals, the translator employs translational tactics, including transposition, addition, substitution, omission, lexical domestication, specification, and generalization.\nThe final aspect of the translation technique involves those cases in which the translator deviates from the default rendering, and these deviations are not in service of translational goals. These divergences include stylistic changes, theological or religious concerns, cases where the translator followed the Greek translation of Zechariah, differences due to implicit vocalization, and translator errors or misreadings.",
