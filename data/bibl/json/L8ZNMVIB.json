    "abstractNote": "In the thought of Isaac of Nineveh (seventh c.), the dimension of \u2018negativity\u2019 plays a crucial role. Isaac uses negative terms and images to outline the conditions of possibility of the encounter with the Absolute: the access to a state of inward emptiness and a capacity for remaining whole and \u2018consisting\u2019 within negation, that he considers crucial for being able to abide in inward emptiness. Isaac describes in negative terms three vital aspects of emptiness: being \u201cempty of (lit.: from) the world\u201d as the outer and inner location of the encounter with God; \u201cnon-prayer\u201d as the non-discursive way of relationship distinctive of this encounter; and \u201cnon-knowledge\u201d as the non-cognitive modality of knowing discovered within it. All of these concepts point to a space \u2018of the inner\u2019, in which \u201cTruth\u201d, that Isaac conceives as being \u201cwithout image\u201d, can reveal itself. Only a human being who has learnt how to pass through negation can sustain the non-conceptual encounter with \u201cTruth\u201d, so that the experience of \u2018being without\u2019, distinctive of contemplation, is in Isaac intimately linked to the capacity for \u2018being without\u2019 that is developed through askesis. The reason for the intimate connection between the ascetic and the contemplative moments of the spiritual life that one finds in Isaac is related to the subject\u2019s capacity to remain whole and \u2018consisting\u2019 within both experiences, which is developed through the \u2018strengthening of the I\u2019 that occurs through askesis and life\u2019s difficulties. This makes it possible for the subject to enter the \u201cdark cloud\u201d (Ex 20:21) of \u201c[God\u2019s] glory\u201d (III 7,5) without becoming lost, through developing a position of faith, distinct from cognitive knowledge.",
