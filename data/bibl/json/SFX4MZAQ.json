    "abstractNote": "Primarily, this dissertation provides a critical text of the hexaplaric fragments of Job 22-42, which updates the previous editions of Field (1875) and Ziegler (1982), and which may serve as the fascicle for the second half of Job for The Hexapla Project. The critical text includes (1) extant readings of the Three, (2) Aristarchian signs' material, and (3) other materials usually related to the Hexapla. The project includes all relevant and available evidence from Hebrew, Greek, Latin, Syriac, and Armenian sources.\nChapter 1 provides a summary of the history of the Hexapla and hexaplaric research. This chapter also presents the methodology for the project and an introduction to interpreting the apparatuses.\nChapter 2 gives a full listing and description of the textual witnesses used for the project. These witnesses include the text groups of Ziegler's Edition , but, regarding the catena tradition of Job, this chapter provides an update to the status questionis by providing a brief history of the catena of Job in past hexaplaric editions and a new way forward.\nChapter 3 provides the critical text. The Hebrew and Greek lemmas are listed first, followed by the hexaplaric attribution and lemma. All variants to the attribution and lemma are listed in the appartuses underneath along with editorial notes.\nChapter 4 contains the readings that are of dubious significance for the Hexapla of Job. These readings are anonymous in the margins of manuscripts, which preserve hexaplaric readings and, therefore, they are included in this separate chapter.\nChapter 5 gives a summary of the preliminary results of the project. This chapter focuses on those instances where Ziegler's Edition has been updated with regard to (1) new fragments and attributions, (2) revision of attribution and lemma, (3) revised attributions, (4) revised lemma, and (5) removed readings.",
