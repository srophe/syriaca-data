    "abstractNote": "Habib ibn Hidma Abu Ra\u2019ita al-Takriti (first half of the 9th century) was the first Syro-Jacobite author who began to create theological works in Arabic. The importance of Abu Ra\u2019ita for his community is quite comparable to that of the famous Theodore Abu Qurra for the Melkites. However, unlike the latter, Abu Ra\u2019ita has been unjustifiably overlooked by scholars. Thus, to date there have been no works in which attempts were made to explore his theological terminology and Christological doctrine. There is not a single work in Russian dedicated to this Jacobite thinker. For a correct understanding of the theological thought of Arab Christian writers of both the 9th and subsequent centuries, it is necessary to understand the extent to which these thinkers acted as continuers of the theological traditions that had developed in their confessional groups at the time of the Arab conquest. In this article, an attempt has been made to reconstruct the conceptual and terminological system of Abu Ra\u2019ita, a comparative analysis of the theological terminologies of Abu Ra\u2019ita and the most prominent representatives of Greek moderate Monophysitism of the 6th century has been carried out, as a result of which it has been established that the common point for at-Takriti and the Greek Monophysites of the Severian trend is the philosophical premise of the fundamental impossibility of the complete actualization of the general in the particular (individual). It is precisely this premise that explains Abu Ra\u2019ita\u2019s rejection of the trinitarian teaching of the Melkites, with which he was familiar from the writings of Abu Qurra. The main difference should be recognized by Abu Ra\u2019ita\u2019s introduction of the concept of \u201csubstance\u201d (\u1e0f\u0101t) into his system, which, being a connecting link between essence (\u01e7awhar) and hypostasis (individual), is meaningfully represents a combination of 1) quiddity (m\u0101hiyyah), that is, a particular copy of the common essence (\u01e7awhar \u02bf\u0101mm); 2) the principle of actual existence as the opposite to non-existence; 3) the principle of particular substantial existence (qiw\u0101m \u1e0f\u0101t \u1e2b\u0101\u1e63\u1e63), that is, separate and self-substantial being.",
