    "abstractNote": "A worshiper as both corporeal and spiritual being cannot confine their prayers only to minds and hearts. However, on the other hand, it is also to be expressed through the worshiper's physical body. The integrity of the liturgical act and prayer is not only by one's vocal pronouncement but also \u201cby\u201d and \u201cwith\u201d one's body. The human body and mind are fitted with a diversity of intellectual and sensual capacities. Thus, Liturgy is expressed orally and takes shape in bodily postures and gestures. This paper explores the traditional components of liturgical gestures and poses in the performance of the Liturgy of the Hours in the Malankara Syrian/West Syrian liturgical tradition. Further, it investigates the use of non-verbal language and its symbolic meaning in the Liturgy of the Hours. Finally, this paper seeks answers to the following questions: based on the performance of the Liturgy of the Hours, can we say that liturgical anthropology is rooted in Kinaesthetic? How does the book of the common prayer contribute and explain the human body as a gift of God and an offering back to God? This study explores the given topic from a liturgical-theological perspective. This approach guarantees and inspires the necessity to preserve and promote the artistic movement and gestures in the Liturgy of the Hours.",
