    "abstractNote": "This article discusses anew the sources of the treatise by Paul the Persian on the scopes of the writings of Aristotle, transmitted by Miskawayh. A whole row of different sources can be identified: The Syriac Long commentary on the Categories by Sergius\u2019 of R\u0113\u0161\u02bfayn\u0101 as well as different Greek works, including obviously Philoponus\u2019 commentary on the Physics, a commentary on the Analytica priora similar to David and Elias and an introduction into logics which resembles a passage in Boethius. Paul probably knew Greek and spent time in a Greek context, where he could collect so many different works. Paul arranged his material in an original way and supplemented points left open by Greek authors. Formally, he introduces a very consequent binary division of entities and treatises absent from the extant Greek sources. It is possibly influenced by East Syrian scholastic culture. Regarding the content, he was the first to explain all five types of syllogism. Especially the understanding of the Greek \u03bc\u03c5\u03b8\u1ff6\u03b4\u03b5\u03c2, as a description of the poetical syllogism, as \u201cimagined\u201d, which is probably due to him, paved the way for the Arabic theories on poetical syllogisms. By writing this treatise, Paul fulfils a never executed promise of Sergius\u2019 of R\u0113\u0161\u02bfayn\u0101, namely explaining the aim(s) of all writings of Aristotle. Thus, he gives the first sketch of a purely Aristotelian curriculum of philosophy in late Antiquity, which is introduced by Sergius\u2019 magnificent image of Aristotle as the master of all sciences. The reception of Paul\u2019s treatise by al-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b and Miskawayh leads to the diffusion of the Aristotelian curriculum, as developed by the two Syro-Persian masters, in Arabic philosophical texts.",
