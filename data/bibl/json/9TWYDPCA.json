    "abstractNote": "The Syriac language was Lingua Franca for several centuries and in many places. Thus, it influenced its sister Semitic languages and even non-Semitic languages. In modern history, we clearly witness its decline, as its original speakers have decreased in quantity and quality, and it is confined only to religious books, clergymen and a small portion of those who are concerned and familiar with it. Hence, by the end of the twentieth century, with the Syriac renaissance, a prosperous page was opened for this language, with the attempt of its speakers to keep pace with the modern times, supporting their longest-living language amongst the languages of the world; therefore, they worked on publishing, authoring and developing new grammar books, and the Arabic language helped them in this respect, as they were greatly influenced by it. However, the orientalists took the lead in this field, as they showed a keen interest in this language, and they classified and analyzed it according to the descriptive approach centuries ago. In these days, the specializations began to abound for the speakers of this language who studied in the West, and a gap with many differences was formed between what they have learned in their countries and what they have studied in the West. As a result, this research aims to reconcile between these two worlds and update the terminology in relation to the morphological patterns and grammatical uses of the standard Syriac verb.",
