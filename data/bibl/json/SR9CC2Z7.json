    "abstractNote": "Ephrem the Syrian is known as one of the greatest Christian poets and as a unique author whose mode of thought is usually described as \u201csymbolic.\u201d In this work, Kees den Biesen explores the literary, intellectual, and theological mechanisms at work in Ephrem\u2019s writings with the specific aim of identifying the exact nature of his \u201csymbolic thought\u201d and evaluating its contemporary relevance.\nCritically reviewing modern research into Ephrem, den Biesen develops the avenues opened up by scholars such as Robert Murray, Sebastian Brock, Tanios Bou Mansour and Phil Botha, and elaborates a comprehensive approach that integrates a variety of methods into a genuinely theological methodology. He exemplifies and fine-tunes this methodology through an analysis of the polarity \u201cword vs. silence\u201d in Ephrem\u2019s madra\u0161e and of the way Ephrem constructs his thought in the epistemological treatise comprised in the First Discourse for Hypatius.\nOn the basis of these innovative explorations, den Biesen examines the most important scholarly interpretations of Ephrem\u2019s theology. With great vision, den Biesen then proposes his own comprehensive understanding of the nature and merits of Ephrem\u2019s symbolic thought. Thanks to his mastery of the art of the word and his familiarity with the world of sacred ritual, Ephrem develops open symbols and concepts into a carefully articulated system whose intelligence far surpasses the cleverness of analytic and logic thought. Ephrem\u2019s symbolism constitutes a linguistic, artistic and intellectual model for a Christian theology that wishes to overcome today\u2019s rationalism and fundamentalism and wisely express and celebrate the mystery of God and life.",
