    "abstractNote": "This thesis examines the ascetic ideal of Ephrem the Syrian (306/07-373 C.E.) as manifested in his hymns, homilies, and prose works. The image of Ephrem that has come down through history is of a monk cloistered in a cell. However, this image is entirely anachronistic as Ephrem belonged to a native proto-monastic tradition that existed in Syria prior to the import of the Egyptian ascetic tradition. This thesis proposes that the ascetic ideal of Saint Ephrem is inherently tied to the notion of the '\u00eeh\u00eeday\u00e2': a 'single' or 'celibate' person living a life in full imitation of Christ. This ideal manifests itself in his writings through the traditional ascetic themes of virginity, baptism, celibacy, sexuality, and the body. Thus, not only does Ephrem's concern for the perfect life in Christ reveal his ascetic ideal, but it also connects him to the Syrian proto-monastic tradition.",
