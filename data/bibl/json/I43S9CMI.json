    "abstractNote": "This paper introduces the reader into the cultural and linguistic dynamics of the Levant during the 6th-9th centuries, a period characterized by the interaction of Greek and Syriac-Aramaic culture, and their transfer to the Arab world. The Levant was culturally diverse. The Syriac theologians have contributed decisively to this diversity. Personalities such as Sergius of R\u0113\u0161\u02bfain\u0101, Athanasius of Balad and Jacob of Edessa translated the Greek philosophers and incorporated this type of philosophical reasoning into their theological treatises. The inheritance of Greek thought was also present at the Medical School of Gund\u012b\u0161\u0101p\u016br, at the Theological Academies of Nisibis and Seleucia-Ctesiphon, and in the monastery centres such as Qenne\u0161r\u012bn (near the Euphrates) and M\u0101r Mattai (near Mosul). It was during this time that both concepts and modes of philosophical reasoning became part of the Syriac-Aramaic theology. This transfer continued between the 8th and 9th centuries to the Arab world, when actors such as \u1e24unain ibn Ish\u0101q returned to Greek culture, and assimilated it at the Caliphs\u2019 court in Baghdad through Syriac-Arabic traductology.",
