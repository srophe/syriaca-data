    "abstractNote": "Various etymologies have been proposed for Arabic <i>all\u0101h </i>but also for Syriac <i>all\u0101h\u0101</i>. It has often been proposed that the Arabic word was borrowed from Syriac. This article takes a comprehensive look at the linguistic evidence at hand. Especially, it takes into consideration more recent epigraphical material which sheds light on the development of the Arabic language. Phonetic and morphological analysis of the data confirms the Arabic origin of the word <i>all\u0101h</i>, whereas the problems of the Syriac form <i>all\u0101h\u0101 </i>are described, namely that the Syriac form differs from that of other Aramaic dialects and begs explanation, discussing also the possibility that the Syriac word is a loan from Arabic. The final part considers qur\u2019anic <i>all\u0101h </i>in its cultural and literary context and the role of the Syriac word in that context.\nThe article concludes, that both, a strictly linguistic, as well as cultural and literary analysis reveals a multilayered interrelation between the two terms in question. The linguistic analysis shows, that Arabic <i>all\u0101h </i>must be a genuinely Arabic word, whereas in the case of Syriac <i>all\u0101h\u0101</i>, the possibility of both, a loan and a specific inner-Aramaic development are laid out. Apart from linguistic considerations, the historical and cultural situation in Northern Mesopotamia, i. e. the early Arab presence in that region is taken into scrutiny. In turn, a possible later effect of the prominent use of Syriac <i>all\u0101h\u0101 </i>on the use in the Qur\u2019an is considered. It is emphasized, that we are presented with a situation of prolonged contact and exchange, rather than merely one-way borrowings.",
