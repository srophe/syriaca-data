    "abstractNote": "The focus of this study is the Syriac Psalter (SyrPss) which is attributed to Paul, the bishop of Tella. A total of ten Mss have been collated for the edition of SyrPss produced for this study. Their descriptions are found in chapter one. Chapter two contains the text of Ms Milan, Ambr. Libr., C. 313. Inf. (with some modifications), and an apparatus of variant readings from the collated Mss. Paul of Tella's version of the Old Testament, the Syrohexapla, is a translation of the Greek fifth column of Origen's Hexapla. However, Alfred Rahlfs, in his edition of the Septuagint Psalms (Psalmi cum Odis), concludes that SyrPss is not inherently hexaplaric (though his analysis of such evidence is incomplete), but Byzantine. In chapter three of the present study, a thorough examination of SyrPss confirms that it is not a primary witness to Origen's text, although it is shown that SyrPss does contain more hexaplaric evidence than Rahlfs allows for. Chapter four is devoted to the breaking down of Rahlfs' vast Byzantine (L) family of Mss into workable units (forty groups are delineated), and to a comparison between SyrPss and each of those units. In chapter five, the implications which arise from the fact that SyrPss is essentially non-hexaplaric and the fact that it actually embraces three distinct text traditions are addressed. The majority of our Mss contain what appears to be a revision of the version attributed to Philoxenus, bishop of Mabbug, a revision which we assign to Paul (SyrPs). One minority tradition (SyrPs('a)) apparently constitutes another revision of the Philoxenian original which may be the work of Thomas of Harkel, while the other (SyrPs('b)) seems to represent a light reworking of SyrPs on the basis of SyrPs('a) by some unknown individual. A number of our Syriac Mss contain a marginal apparatus of hexaplaric readings, most of which have been recorded by Frederick Field in Origenis Hexaplorum quae supersunt. A concluding appendix to the present study contains both corrections to Field's entries and new evidence from Syriac Ms sources not available to him.",
