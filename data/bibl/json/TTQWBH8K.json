    "abstractNote": "During late antiquity, the ways in which hospitality towards the stranger had been expressed in Greco-Roman society expanded in a number of ways. Hospices and hospitals began to develop in the east, the practice of receiving the translated relics of martyrs emerged, and the rise of asceticism began to lead to the care by monks of the stranger in need. Exiled bishops were increasingly relocated to remote areas, where their reception by local communities was mixed. The maturation of Constantinople as the capital of the eastern empire saw the influx of numerous individuals from other provinces who came (and often stayed for months, if not years) seeking imperial and senatorial favour. The Vandal invasions led to the need to handle the relocation and care of refugees from Italy and North Africa, some of whom made their way into eastern provinces. The rise of spectacular pillar saints in Syria spurred the growth of hagiotourism, which drew Christian pilgrims in large numbers from the far-flung corners of the Mediterranean. This article seeks to draw out the diversity of what it meant to welcome the stranger in the late antique east with specific attention to the imperial capital, Constantinople, and to the province of Syria.",
