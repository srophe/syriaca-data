    "abstractNote": "This dissertation explores the use of 'Rest' (\u1f00\u03bd\u03ac\u03c0\u03b1\u03c5\u03c3\u03b9\u03c2) terminology in the Pseudo-Macarian Corpus, dating between 370 and 420 CE in the region of Syro-Mesopotamia or Asia Minor. The study examines the ways that Pseudo-Macarius uses this significant terminology in the three primary collections of the Macarian Corpus and how 'Rest' relates to his overarching theological vision. The author of the Macarian Corpus draws from a variety of traditions and this study examines how those sources inform his theology. The theme of Rest serves as both the root and apex of his reflections on the nature of humanity, his understanding of Jesus Christ and the Holy Spirit, the need for entering into the spiritual combat, and the Sabbath. Finally, this dissertation searches for contributions that Macarius' view of 'Rest' could make to the contemporary discussion of Sabbath.\nUsing the Thesaurus Linguae Graecae database, the citations of 'Rest' in the three major collections of the Macarian Corpus were identified. These passages were then examined for theological themes and analyzed for their significance for Macarian theology. For each major topic, the historical developments and contemporaneous views were researched and included in the study.\nThis analysis revealed that: 1) Rest is absolutely central to the theology of the Macarian Corpus. 2) Earlier scholars who detected the importance of Rest in the Macariana were correct, although this topic had remained unexplored. 3) Macarius draws from a variety of sources and these sources are detectable in his use of Rest. 4) Rest terminology grew rapidly in usage from the second century BCE to the fourth century CE. 5) Rest is a key theological and liturgical theme in Syrian Christianity. 6) Rest is connected to the imago Dei and biblical anthropomorphism. 7) Rest is connected to a nexus of themes related to \u1f14\u03c1\u03c9\u03c2 and nuptial imagery. 8) Macarius draws upon the earlier melding of Sabbath as divine time and Sanctuary as divine dwelling place that began with the Songs of Sabbath Sacrifice and the Epistle to the Hebrews. 9) The Macarian understanding of Rest adds an important voice to the contemporary discussion of the meaning of Sabbath.",
