    "abstractNote": "The Babylonian Judaism, that has formed the Babylonian Gemara to the Mishnah, came into contact mainly with the Syriac Christianity. The Syriac language, which were used there belongs with Mandaic and Aramaic of the Babylonian Talmud to the same group of the Eastern Aramaic dialects. Undoubtedly this situation has facilitated contact and exchange of ideas between Jewish and local Christian communities. Both the Jewish synagogues and the Syriac churches were using the same text of Tanakh, which was translated into Syriac probably in the Judeo-Christian circles. Thus has the Jewish community known the Syriac text of the New Testament? If so, then in which version: Diatessaron, Peshitta or Vetus Syra of the New Testament? An important source of information about the relationship between Jewish and Christian communities are apocrypha \u2013 some developed in the common literary circles. In addition, the Syriac patristic literature, on the one hand, shows the influence of Judaic exegetical techniques or at least its literary motifs on the Christian literature. On the other hand, it reflects the growing conflict between religions. Some features of this literature could have some influence on the development of the Babylonian Gemara topics related to Jesus, Mary and Christians. Thus, the Syrian Christianity was an eyewitness to the gradual detachment of Christianity from Judaism, even in the third century and the disappearance of Judeo-Christianity.",
