    "abstractNote": "From amongst the ninety-two works of John the Solitary this article deals with the selected two, concerned with fasting. The author, known also as John of Apamea, was an important figure of the Syriac tradition of the fifth century. He was a monastic master whose doctrine required the complete \u2018emptying\u2019 of oneself of the things of this world, in accordance with the kenosis of Jesus himself. Many texts have been attributed to the Solitary, many have yet to be published, and biographical data is so scant in his writings that it is difficult to identify him with certainty. The two selected discourses on fasting in this paper were directed to a monastic community, and present a religious doctrine of fasting which is comprised of various admonitions advising the monk to make a careful choice when deciding between the path of good and the path of evil. This study does not pretend to exhaust the general theme of fasting, not least because of the complex strands which surround this ancient monastic theme. It does, however, subject the Solitary\u2019s treatment of fasting to examination through the lens of ethical, social, psychological, and religious disciplines. Fasting is thereby revealed to be a practice whose genesis is to be found in human impulses of varying origins and intensity, and one which is not an end in itself so much as an important part of the monastic ascetical programme whose ultimate purpose is the acquiring of spiritual depth and charity towards God and neighbour.",
