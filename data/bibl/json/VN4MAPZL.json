    "abstractNote": "Amongst the understudied fields in mainstream history is the significant role many Christian scholars had in the Islamic Golden Age. Amongst the many prominent figures, Hunayn ibn \u2018Ish\u0101q was one of the leaders of the translation movement established by Islamic caliphs in the 9th century. Other examples and more in-depth analyses of several Christian scholars\u2019 works and contributions will shed light on and give a holistic picture of the advancement of knowledge in the Middle East from the 9th to 10th centuries. This article highlights what historical psychosocial conditions allowed for such interreligious cooperation and progress. It also highlights the role of shared scholarship as a model for coexistence, tolerance, and finding common ground in the \u2018Abb\u0101sid society in Baghdad, which I argue are products of the outlook of scholars at the time. It is argued that the cooperation of Muslim and Christian scholars was a result of two components of what can be interpreted as being a \u201csocial contract.\u201d The first is an agreement between Muslim and Christian scholars, and the second is an agreement between Christian scholars and the \u2018Abb\u0101sid government.",
