    "abstractNote": "Missionaries of Christ's church, both eastern and western, have yet to communicate the gospel in ways that result in Kurds gathering into viable, indigenous churches. Protestants have been active in Kurdistan since the 1840s and Catholics for three centuries, to say nothing of the historical churches of the East.\nThis study reviews the record of the Protestant and, to a lesser extent, Catholic missions. The study purports to show that the Protestant strategy of assisting the historical churches in Kurdistan, with the stated hope that a revived Eastern Church would evangelize its Kurdish neighbors, has failed to plant a viable indigenous church among the Kurds. The results of this thesis suggest areas of change needed by western Christians involved in evangelism among Kurds.",
