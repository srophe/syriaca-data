    "abstractNote": "In the present study is underlined the importance of mastering the original Syriac terminology of a spiritual author such as the Syrian Isaac. To illustrate this practically, the attention of the authors focuses on a term that has not been studied in detail by researchers of Isaac\u2019s writings until now. The noun \u0719\u0718\u0308\u0725\u0710) zaw\u2018e), \u2018stirrings\u2019, is a key technical term in the language of the Syriac hermit. Based on the Syriac texts of Isaac, the paper shows that there are several types of stirrings. In terms of their origin and action, they are positives or negatives. Considered from an anthropological perspective, the stirrings may be classified into voluntary and involuntary. In the last part of the paper are presented various contexts in which the stirrings relate to various ascetical practices or works, showing that, in Isaac's thinking, they presuppose a certain synergy between man and grace. Although his writings are primarily addressed to monks and especially hermits, the term in question denotes inner spiritual realities that every Christian experiences and that is why Isaac\u2019s insights are of utmost importance to all who wish to progress spiritually.",
