    "abstractNote": "This article focuses on the Arabic manuscript collection of the Near Eastern School of Theology (NEST). The NEST library contains several manuscripts that were donated, copied, or read by important Christian-born intellectuals of the nah\u1e0da. Given these men\u2019s role in the emergence of modern publishing in the Middle East, I examine the intersections between their scribal and printing activities. I also discuss works of grammar, logic, and rhetoric in the NEST\u2019s collection. Most of these are by late medieval and early modern authors and contain extensive commentaries and glosses. This commentary culture was a key site of learning throughout the early modern Ottoman Empire and endured among Christian as well as Muslim intellectuals of the nah\u1e0da movement. The persistence of these scribal and intellectual traditions reveals a longue dur\u00e9e of Islamicate scholarly traditions that is only beginning to be understood by historians of Arab modernity.",
