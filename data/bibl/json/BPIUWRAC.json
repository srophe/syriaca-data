    "abstractNote": "Chapter One is a history of research into R 1.33-71. Research into the Recognitions (R) began around 1500. With the Tubingen School, R was considered important for understanding the New Testament Church. In 1849, R. Kostlin first isolated a source in R 1 and identified it as The Ascents of James (AJ; Greek Anabathmoi Iakobou known by the citation from Epiphanius\u2019 Panarion. In the twentieth century, the hypothesis of an AJ source gained acceptance by most researchers, although the limits of the AJ in R 1 have been continually debated. Chapter Two uses source-critical methods to isolate a discrete document in R 1.33.3-1.44.3, 1.55-1.62, 1.64.1- 1.69.1, and 1.69.8-1.71. This source is then identified as The Ascents of James. The unity of the AJ is defended against H. J. Schoeps, G. Ludemann, and others. Chapter Three presents, in parallel columns, fresh translations of the AJ from the best critical texts of the Latin and Syriac versions of R 1. Chapter Four is a commentary on the AJ. It offers a treatment of technical matters (text, grammar, literary forms, etc.) and an interpretation of the three sections of the AJ: a history of salvation from Abraham to the early church (1.33-44); the debate of the Twelve Apostles with the Jewish parties in the temple (1.55-65); and the speech of James and its aftermath (1.66-71). Chapter Five analyzes the major issues of the interpretation of the AJ. The theology of the AJ centers on Jesus as the Mosaic Prophet and Messiah. The historicity of the AJ\u2019s portrait of the earliest church is rejected. In its imaginative narrative, however the AJ community presents its own belief. This community is a Jewish-Christian church in the area of Pella in Transjordan. It observes the Mosaic law and practices baptism as the replacement of sacrifice. It blames Paul for preventing the success of the mission to the Jews. The AJ was written in the second half of the second century to reinforce the faith and self-understanding of its community.",
