    "abstractNote": "The article centers on a set of rabbinic principles\u2014ve\u2018asita ha-yashar ve-ha-tov (\u201cyou shall do that which is upright and good\u201d), kofin \u2018al middat sedom (\u201cwe [=a court] may coerce regarding the ways of Sodom\u201d), le-ma\u2018an telekh be-derekh tovim (\u201cso that you shall walk in the way of the virtuous\u201d), and lifnim mi-shurat ha-din (\u201c[going] within the line of the law\u201d)\u2014which establish a heightened standard of moral behavior in the sphere of private law. It is argued that these principles were developed and systematized mainly in the context of the Babylonian (rather than Palestinian) branch of rabbinic legal culture and are, therefore, reflective of the distinctive cultural and jurisprudential environment of the Syro-Mesopotamian Near East. It is mainly in this context that moral principles and values are said to establish fully-normative, justiciable, and enforceable standards of behavior in excess of the strict law. The rabbinic principles are contextualized with the adjacent East Syrian Christian and Iranian legal traditions, focusing in particular on \u012a\u0161\u014d\u02bfb\u014dxt\u2019s taxonomy of moral and legal categories. It is argued that the category of \u201cuprightness\u201d (tri\u1e63\u016bt\u0101) informs the rabbinic principles of performing that which is \u201cupright and good\u201d and avoiding the \u201cmeasure of Sodom,\u201d which require good faith and fair dealing, and seek to prevent unconscionable behavior and abuse of rights, whereas the category of acting in excess of the law or short of the law (yat\u012br\u016bt / has\u012br\u016bt din\u0101) informs the rabbinic principles of acting \u201cwithin the line of the law\u201d and \u201cwalking in the path of the virtuous,\u201d which require altruistic and supererogatory behavior\u2014to the extent of incurring financial loss\u2014and involve a dimension of distributive justice.",
