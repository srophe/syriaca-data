    "abstractNote": "The ideology of victory in Theodoret's Ecclesiastical History, similarly in the work of Eusebius of Caesarea, of which he was a continuator, has three dimensions: military, martyrdom and doctrinal. All three were related to the war waged by the evil spirit against God and amounted to winning victories in the name of Christ. For the Christian Theodoret, military victories in the confrontation with pagan enemies had a sacred aspect and proved the truth of the Christian religion and the power of God of Christians, an ally of Christian rulers, and, on the other hand, the falsity of the beliefs of the followers of traditional cults. The martyrs, on the other hand, gave their lives for Christ and won victories following His example. Likewise, defenders of orthodoxy, by advocating the victorious truth, became winners themselves. Theodoret's speculations on peace expressed in the conclusion of his Ecclesiastical History are extremely interesting. He argues that war brings greater benefits to Christians than peace. This, in turn, makes them lethargic and lazy, while war sharpens their characters and makes them aware of the fragility of earthly life and teaches them to despise the present, and therefore puts them on the right track of Christian eschatology. In the light of the ideology of victory proclaimed by Theodoret, the confrontation of Christians with opponents of their faith created opportunities in various fields to achieve victories in Christ.",
