    "abstractNote": "This article explores the impact of a century of cultural trauma and marginalisation on the shaping of modern Iraqi Assyrians\u2019 identity and their present-day experiences, including their decisions and sense of belonging to their homeland. Using questionnaire and interview data, we explore how Assyrians who participated in this study respond to a century of persecution during and since WWI, and discuss their current situation in relation to their ethnic and cultural rights in Iraq. Based on data collected from Iraqi Assyrians who reside in various geographical places, we argue that these Assyrians still see themselves on the receiving end of ongoing marginalisation which has long precedents and has not only become part of their identity, but continues to shape their present-day experiences and decisions about where to settle. Nevertheless, we found that historical events have reinforced Assyrians\u2019 ethnic identity and their affiliation with their heritage and religion. The findings are discussed in relation to how cultural trauma shapes a group\u2019s collective identity and experiences.",
