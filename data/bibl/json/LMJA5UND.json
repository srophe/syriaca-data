    "abstractNote": "A group of Syriac Christian believers existed during the fourth century called the <i>Bnay Qy\u014dmo</i> (with their female counterparts known as the <i>Bnoth Qy\u014dmo</i>): the Sons and Daughters of the Covenant. There has been considerable controversy about the nature of this archaic Syrian monastic movement or, as it is known to some scholars, the Syriac \u201cProto-Monastic Tradition\u201d. The controversy has not only been about the name, but also the origin, habits, and ascetic way of life of the <i>Bnay Qy\u014dmo</i>. The intention of the present article is not to elaborate on the various terminology used to describe the <i>Bnay Qy\u014dmo</i> or the nature of their vows and expected duties as introduced by Aphrahat and other Syrian Fathers, for these have been studied by many scholars. Rather, the intention of this article is to review some of the material discussing this group by key Syriac Fathers to present a fresh reading of the historical record to better apprize the order\u2019s regulations and its social and ecclesiastical roles within the Syriac-speaking Church during the fourth and fifth centuries AD. The main Syriac writers who dealt with this topic were Aphrahat, known as \u201cthe Persian Sage\u201d (ca. 260\u2013345), and Rabula, Bishop of Edessa (flor. 420s). Whilst the order appears to have declined by about the eighth century, understanding the roles of the <i>Bnay Qy\u014dmo</i> during the earlier period (the focus of this writing) is crucial for explaining the development of the Syriac Tradition.",
