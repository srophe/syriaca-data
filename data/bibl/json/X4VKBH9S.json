    "abstractNote": "In agreement with his East Syriac heritage, I\u0161\u00f4`d\u00e2dh\u2019s commentary on Ezekiel does not contain any direct messianic interpretations. There are, however, interpretations that link the text to Christ or are of importance for I\u0161\u00f4`d\u00e2dh\u2019s Christology. As far as Christology is concerned, his interpretation of Ezekiel 1:27\u201328 is important, where he rejects interpretations related to the two natures of Christ. The interpretation of Theodoret of Cyrus is especially relevant in this regard, but also others, such as Gregory. In addition to this, in some instances I\u0161\u00f4`d\u00e2dh sees a double meaning in a text or a typological reference. These texts receive attention in this paper, with special attention to I\u0161\u00f4`d\u00e2dh\u2019s exegesis of Ezekiel 1 and 47. In his interpretation of Ezekiel 1, he looks in the first place at the time of the prophet, for example in referring to different interpretations of the living creatures and their faces, such as the four regions of the world, the four seasons, the four elements or kings of Babylonia, of the Medes, the Persians and the Greeks. It can, however, also refer to Christ, with the four creatures representing the Gospels. The river of Ezekiel 47 is also linked to the dispensation of the New Testament. These texts are studied in detail in this paper, especially in comparison to the interpretation of Theodoret.",
