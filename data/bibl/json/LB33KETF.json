    "abstractNote": "This dissertation is a study of the literary works of the Nestorian Patriarch, Timothy I (727-823), with a view to explaining his methodology and to elucidating his defense of Christianity. As a comparative study the dissertation attempts to understand the letters of Timothy within the framework of the general apologetic, polemic literature which was produced by Christians and Muslims during the first Abbasid century. A number of so far unpublished letters of Timothy, as found in Vat. Syr. Mis. 605, are summarised and then utilized in furthering an understanding of Timothy as churchman and apologist. Chapter I outlines what is known of Timothy's life from the relevant Syriac and Arabic sources. Timothy's roles as patriarch and pastor are examined as an important context for the interpretation of his apologetics. This chapter also describes in detail the content and focus of the apologetic letters of Timothy, particularly those that have not been published. Chapter II studies the methodology of Timothy's controversial and theology, as this method is delineated in Timothy's own statements of intentions and purpose. The chapter examines the place of scripture, the fathers, and reason in Timothy's letters. This analysis then provides the framework for an examination, in Chapter III, of Timothy's treatment of the standard topics in the Christian-Muslim controversies of his time. These topics are the Trinity, the Incarnation, and the discernment of the true religion. In Chapter IV Timothy and his apologetic works are placed in relationship to the condition which prevailed in his time and to other apologetic efforts, in both Syriac and Arabic, which took place during the first Abbasid century.",
