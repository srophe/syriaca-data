    "abstractNote": "This dissertation analyzes encounter and exchange between Christianity and Islam in late antiquity and the Middle Ages through the lens of saints\u2019 stories, their textual and oral narrators, and their audiences. It draws on a broad array of Greek, Syriac, and Arabic texts, including saints\u2019 lives, homilies such as those of Jacob of Sarug (d. 521), the Qur\u2019\u0101n and qur\u2019\u0101nic commentaries, the Biography of Muhammad, local and universal historiographical works, belles-lettres, and travel literature, among others. The first part studies hagiographical storytelling (hagiodiegesis) as a religious practice in Christianity and Islam. Through narratological analysis, it reconstructs the agents, methods, and contexts of hagiographical storytelling in antiquity \u2013a significant yet understudied practice. As the dissertation demonstrates, Muhammad and others in the early Islamic community were transmitters, narrators, and interpreters of Christian saints\u2019 stories, participating in the broader world of late antiquity. This social-historical reconstruction lays the groundwork for analyzing the roles of Christian hagiography in Islamic literature. Until now, this question has mostly been considered in the context of qur\u2019\u0101nic exegesis. The dissertation shows that Christian saints\u2019 personas and stories were also used as didactic examples of universal piety and wisdom; as \u201cexcellences\u201d (fa\u1e0d\u0101\u2019il) to praise towns and regions; as members of the eternal Muslim community; and as etiologies for Islamic beliefs and practices. This dissertation nuances our understanding of Christian-Muslim relations in the Middle Ages by taking the inquiry beyond the confines of impact and influence. Transmissions of Christian hagiographical knowledge were not isolated instances of exchange, nor was Christian hagiography merely a reservoir of tropes for the Muslim author. Narration and veneration of saints was a shared space, which was constantly expanded, negotiated, and contested between Christianity and Islam. The increasing knowledge of Christian saints in Islam allowed Muslim communities to participate in a broader ecumenical exchange. This knowledge provided Muslim authors with a creative, flexible space for developing different modes of authorship. It helped Muslim communities define Islamic notions of asceticism and sanctity vis-\u00e0-vis Christian concepts and discourse. And overall Christian hagiography was a powerful medium with which Muslim communities built and expressed their distinct local identities.",
