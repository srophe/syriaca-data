    "abstractNote": "This dissertation is a study of the political, social and economic interaction of soldiers and civilians in Roman Syria and Mesopotamia from the reign of Augustus to the Arab Conquest.\nPart One examines the interrelationship of urbanism and the Roman army, using archaeological and epigraphic evidence, in particular looking at the phenomenon of army units based in or near cities in the Principate, and the development of fortress cities in the later empire.\nPart Two is a study of the political, social and cultural interaction of soldiers and civilians, examining the army as an agency of control, and issues such as the ethnic and cultural identities of soldiers.\nPart Three is a study of the role of the army in the regional economy of Syria and Mesopotamia, looking at the interrelationship of taxation, army pay, army supply, production and trade.\nThe general theme of the study is that despite the physical proximity of large concentrations of soldiers and civilians there was greater social and cultural separation than one might expect from a superficial examination of the evidence, and that the army was primarily an agency of control and exploitation of the provinces rather than a factor in their development.",
