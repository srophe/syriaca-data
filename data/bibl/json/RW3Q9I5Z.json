    "abstractNote": "The dissertation treats the problem of the direct influence of the Septuagint (= LXX) on the Peshitta (= P) Old Testament in Genesis and Psalms. In secondary literature, the P Old Testament is often described either as significantly shaped by the LXX or as a daughter version of the LXX. These twentieth century views rest largely on two studies, that of J. Hanel on Genesis and that of A. Vogel on Psalms. While Hanel presents an ad hoc list of evidence, Vogel offers three categories of agreement where he finds direct LXX influence. Neither Hanel nor Vogel attempt to be comprehensive in their citation of evidence, but offer only selected examples. In the model advanced by the translator of the P used the LXX as a help when he was confronted with problems. In the model of Vogel, by contrast, a reviser made use of the LXX to correct the already existing P text. In my dissertation I attempt to define and evaluate the criteria used in alleging that the LXX directly influenced the P version of the Hebrew Bible, either at the translation stage or in a subsequent revision. The following criteria were identified and evaluated: shared exegesis, the use of Greek words in Syriac where the Peshitta had a good Syriac equivalent available, translation technique, doublets, shared variants/non- variants, shared variants and the presence of Grecisms in P. My study seeks to be comprehensive by listing all extra-massoretic agreements between P and LXX. For Genesis and Psalms, I concluded that there is no sound evidence to support the theory that the LXX directly influenced P. This result should cause scholars and students to reappraise P and regard it as an independent source of ancient exegesis, translation technique and textual criticism of the Hebrew Bible.",
