    "abstractNote": "Based on archival research in Scotland and the US, his paper examines the founding of the Lebanese mission of the Presbyterian Free Church of Scotland (FCS) in the 1870s. The heart of his article is a presentation of differences of perception and self-representation that are found in the reports of British and American observers of the 1869/1870 visit of Alexander Duff (convener of the Foreign Missions Committee of the FCS) and John Lumsden (representative of the interdenominational Lebanon Schools Committee) to Protestant schools in Beirut and throughout Lebanon. Alexander Duff, for whom \"the key element in mission work was the school\" (p. 174), did not perceive any reasons for possible conflict with already established missionary and educational activities of the American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions in Syria. The Americans, however, represented in Marten's discussion through the views of D. S. Dodge and H. H. Jessup, felt that the Scottish visit was an intrusion into territory that was already established both as an area of American missionary influence and as a region in which a reformed/Protestant Syrian church presence had taken root. Although Duff and Lumsden had misrepresented American views in their reports to their own constituencies, in the end, the American side agreed to and generously collaborated with the de facto establishment of the presence of the FCS in Lebanon. From the American perspective, the goal of attracting Muslims to the Christian faith was better served by Protestant Christians acting in unison with one another than by furthering an image of quarrelling and divisiveness among Christians, an impression too familiar to Muslims, who according to Marten's assessment of American voices (p. 183) had witnessed for centuries the struggles, schisms, and splits of the Latin and Greek Christians.",
