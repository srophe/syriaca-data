    "abstractNote": "This article presents an edition, translation, and analysis of a prefatory letter addressed by the Galen translator \u1e24unayn ibn Is\u1e25\u0101q (d. 873) to one of his East-Syrian Christian patrons, the physician Salmawayh ibn Bun\u0101n (d. 840). \u1e24unayn composed this Letter to Salmawayh ibn Bun\u0101n in Syriac, but it survives only in his nephew's Arabic translation. Since its discovery over eighty years ago, the text has received little attention and has never before been published in its entirety. The Letter provides new insight into \u1e24unayn's early career and the Christian milieu in which he moved, demonstrating his indebtedness to the Syriac literary past exemplified by the prefaces of the earlier Galen translator Sergius of R\u0113\u0161\u02bfayn\u0101 (d. 536). At the same time, the Letter indicates part of what made \u02bfAbb\u0101sid-era translators like \u1e24unayn different from their late ancient predecessors. This study argues that increased demand from patrons and \u1e24unayn's close reading of Galen's Hippocratic commentaries yielded the Letter\u2019s novel claim that readers of all abilities can and should have access to ancient Greek scientific texts. In this way, the Letter hints tantalizingly at \u1e24unayn's understanding of his own literary and scientific project and its relationship with the ancient Greek tradition.",
