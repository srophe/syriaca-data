    "abstractNote": "In his final report of the excavations at Dura-Europos, Syria, the scholar Carl Kraeling established the site\u2019s Christian Building as the ancient world\u2019s preeminent example of a <i>domus ecclesiae</i>, a house converted into a church through architectural adaptation. In Kraeling\u2019s interpretation, a private domestic structure (House M8A) built in 232 CE was later remade as a community-owned church through a single, deliberate program of modification. This article engages with legacy ideas about the Christian Building, unexplored archival records, and recent studies of Dura-Europos to rethink the building\u2019s phases, functions, and dating. I argue that House M8A was not the domus ecclesiae that Kraeling envisioned\u2014wholly, instantly, and permanently converted to a church\u2014but a Christian house that retained a domestic aspect even as it was adapted for religious activity. The article proposes new phases for the building and advances an earlier chronology for its construction in the late second or early third century CE, a time that better fits revised estimates of Dura\u2019s Roman development. This reinterpretation of the world\u2019s oldest domestic church building bears significant repercussions for our understanding of early Christian architecture and communities and underscores the value of critical thinking and revisiting legacy ideas in archaeology.",
