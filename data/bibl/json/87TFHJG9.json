    "abstractNote": "The so-called Christian Orient can be characterized both by its unity which is manifest from the existence of its lingua franca (Greek in antiquity, and Arabic from the Middle Ages down to the present), and by its multiple cultural interactions which can be best seen in the way various literary works were transmitted from one language into another. From both points of view, the case of the Life of Macarius, which is preserved in various languages of the Christian Orient, deserves special attention, especially because its Greek version seems to derive from its Arabic version, as the present article shows.",
