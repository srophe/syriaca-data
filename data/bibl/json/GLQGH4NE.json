Here a serious student of sociology masterfully analyses, more or less within a Weberian framework, two interrelated aspects of the problem of authority in the community of St. Thomas Christians: routinization and centralization. The attempt has yielded rich returns in terms of new insights and significant discoveries. These insights and discoveries could help one to look at the history of this particular community in a fresh way and even revise earlier evaluations and conclusions\" (from the foreword by A. N. Mundadan).\nPart one gives a historical and theoretical background for the study. Part two is a historical analysis. Part three is an empirical study of the present time, with dozens of data tables. Part four gives conclusions and major findings. With an extensive bibliography, the data gathering forms, and an index.",
