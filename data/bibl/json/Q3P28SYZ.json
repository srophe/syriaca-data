    "abstractNote": "Nostra Aetate was initially conceived as a statement on the Church\u2019s relationship with the Jews. The decision to place it on the Council\u2019s agenda was solely that of Pope John XXIII who wished to address the Christian \u201cteaching of contempt\u201d for Jews which gave rise to the Holocaust. The Catholic Patriarchs and bishops from the Arab world, however, feared the statement would be interpreted politically as in the Middle East politics and religion were intertwined. If the statement was construed as the beginning of the Vatican\u2019s recognition of Israel, the Church\u2019s numerous educational and religious missions in the region would be jeopardized. The Eastern bishops argued that a statement on the Jewish people should be accompanied by a statement on Muslims. Little understood in the development of the declaration, especially the statement on Islam, is the influence that scholars, missionaries, and centers for Islamic learning in Cairo and Tunis had on Nostra Aetate. This chapter reveals the role of these missionary scholars and institutions and concludes with a section on current trends in Muslim\u2013Christian relations.",
