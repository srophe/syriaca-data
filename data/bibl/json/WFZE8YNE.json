    "abstractNote": "This article presents an instructive example of cultural interaction between Iran and Germany at the end of the 19th century: the movement of the \u201cLutheran Nestorians\u201d. A group of Eastern Syriac priests (\u201cNestorians\u201d) from the Urmia region in Northwest Iran came to Germany to pursue their theological formation at Lutheran institutions, whereafter they returned to Iran and continued to work, albeit within the parameters of a complex relationship, with their Mother Church. Although the initial purpose and intention of the priests\u2019 decision to come to Germany is obscure, the influence of their cultural experience in the West is clear. Specifically, Western values and habits formed the perspective with which they assessed the cultural development of Iran after their return to their native land (I). The priests constantly had to balance their orientation toward the West with their personal and intellectual connection to their home tradition; how difficult this situation was becomes apparent in their endeavor to redefine Eastern Syriac heritage by means of Lutheran theology (II). These priests made an important contribution to the cultural exchange between both countries even though they lived in manifold tensions (III). Thus, the \u201cLutheran Nestorians\u201d can be perceived as exponents of a \u201cbipolar\u201d way of life, since they felt they belonged to (at least) two cultures. Their stories indicate that the antagonism between East and West, Orient and Occident is too simple to cover the complexities of history.",
