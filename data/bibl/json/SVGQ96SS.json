    "abstractNote": "This contribution begins with a presentation of the textual attestation of the legend of Abgar of Edessa. Subsequently, the ideological aim is illustrated as it has been reconstructed by recent research, with particular attention given to the variation between the different redactional stages. The author proposes to interpret this legend not only as the political programme of an increasingly important Christian elite in Osrhoene between the fourth and fifth century, but also as a polemical response to certain forms of Christianity that were now deemed heretical. The school created by Bardesanes of Edessa (first half of the third century), with its project of Christianity like a network of philosophical circles, cognizant of the culture of the civic elite and willing to share some of its values despite a different religious orientation, was rejected in favour of a vision of the Christian community that placed a high value upon two aspects: on the one hand, the contribution to be made by a political power that was no longer pagan, but Christian orthodox and willing to aid the Church in its mission and, on the other hand, a Christian culture faithful to the canon and Trinitarian orthodoxy, but opposed to theological research. Lastly, this contribution elucidates how this Christian proposal was influenced by certain incidents in religious life - especially Manichaean proselytism and the condemnation of Paul of Samosata - that affected the region in the second half of the third century AD. The episode involving Paul of Samosata marks a new stage in how the Christian communities of the Near East viewed political authority and its relationship to the Church.",
