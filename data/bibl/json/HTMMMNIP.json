    "abstractNote": "The text that this thesis examines\n                    is most commonly referred to by modern scholars as the Apocalypse of Pseudo-Ezra\n                    (Ps.-Ezra). It is a historical apocalyptic text that claims authorship by the\n                    biblical character Ezra, but there is no question that it is the pseudonymous\n                    product of a much later Syriac-speaking Christian author who writes in response\n                    to the Arab conquests and subsequent consolidation of Arab political and\n                    religious dominance under the caliphate. Ps.-Ezra is a brief work, but an\n                    enigmatic one, and has received only scant scholarly attention. Although\n                    nineteenth- century translations based on three individual manuscripts were made\n                    into German, French, and English respectively, no critical edition or full-scale\n                    study based on multiple manuscripts has yet appeared.\nThe primary goal of\n                    this project, then, is to produce an edition of the Syriac Ps.-Ezra with a\n                    critical apparatus noting variants in the manuscript tradition. The edition is\n                    accompanied by an English translation in order to make Ps.-Ezra accessible to a\n                    wider range of scholars and students. To orient readers to the text, an\n                    introduction to and analysis of Ps.-Ezra is provided. In my approach, I am most\n                    interested in studying Ps.-Ezra as an example of the ways that Syriac-speaking\n                    Christians used the genre of apocalypse to reconcile their deeply held\n                    theological and historical expectations with their often different lived\n                    realities. In particular, the thesis highlights the ways Pseudo-Ezra used,\n                    reused, and reimagined sacred texts in order to respond to the theological\n                    challenges presented by Arab rule.",
