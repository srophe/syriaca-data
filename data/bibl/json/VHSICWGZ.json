    "abstractNote": "\"The article consists of two parts. The first part introduces very briefly the life and the work of Abu Qurrah, The second presents and studies the four passages where Abu Qurrah mentions the Maronites. Abbu Qurrah was born at Edessa around 755, became a monk in Saint-Sabas' Monastery, and was appointed bishop of Harran around 795. Between 812 and 815, he tried to win the Armenians, the Copts and the Syrians over the doctrine of Chalcedon, setting out on journeys for that very purpose. In 829, he had a theological debate at Edessa in the presence of the caliph al-Ma'mun. He left us 43 treatises in Greek, one work (lost) in Syriac, and 28 treatises (mainly apologetic) in Arabic. From the four texts quoted, one can deduce as follows: the Maronites are Melkites, since they accept Chalcedon. He reproaches them for refusing the two following councils, because they were convoked by the emperor. Finally, they constituted a theological school affirming that \"the faculties which were in the human composition became virtually non-existent it is World that was their director and mover.\" (p. 33)",
