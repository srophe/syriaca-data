    "abstractNote": "Pirqe de-Rabbi Eliezer (PRE) is a watershed in the history of rabbinic literature. This ninth-century work, an account of \"biblical history\" from creation until the time of Esther, is the first extended, continuous narrative of any sort in rabbinic literature. It is also, in all probability, the first major rabbinic work to derive from the hand of a single author. The most remarkable aspect of PRE, however, is its introduction into the rabbinic tradition of several legends about biblical figures which are not found in the classical rabbinic corpus. Modern scholarship considers the non-rabbinic legends in PRE an example of the survival of Second Temple literature within the Jewish tradition. The present study, however, attempts to explain the non-rabbinic material found in PRE as the result of the author\u2019s adoption (and adaptation) of elements from the surrounding Christian and Muslim cultures rather than a direct transmission of Second Temple works among Jews. This hypothesis is tested through the examination of two works close to PRE in form and content, the Book of Jubilees (Hebrew, second century BCE) and the Cave of Treasures (Syriac, 6th century CE). All three are accounts of \"Sacred History,\" that is, the history of ancient Israel as recounted independently of the biblical text.",
