Attention is also given to the authors who are his primary sources, namely, Avicenna and Aristotle. Parallel examples include Albert the Great as another author who is dependent on some of the same sources and Pliny the Elder as a Latin author without Arabic influences. Roughly, Avicenna and Barhebraeus can be understood as allowing for or stating the observation of far more dreaming animals than Aristotle himself did explicitly, while Albert allows for even fewer. The question of why on this matter Barhebraeus relied primarily on these two authors as his sources, though not on other post-Avicennan Arabic authors as he did in many of his other philosophical and even theological works, will also be briefly discussed. This select reliance could be connected to a historical change in the topics dealt with in the scientific curriculum, with the lack of coverage of zoological topics by Barhebraeus’s favorite source authors being one of the reasons that led him to rely on the older texts by Avicenna and Aristotle. However, this cannot be generalized as a rule, as there are at least two contrary cases in Barhebraeus’s works on physiognomics where he has had recourse to an older text rather than a treatise by one of his otherwise preferred source authors.</note></biblStruct><bibl type="formatted" subtype="bibliography" resp="https://www.zotero.org/styles/chicago-note-bibliography-17th-edition">
