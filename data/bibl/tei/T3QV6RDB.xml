In turn, Rome became a destination for pilgrims, students, and curious itinerants. Among that number were Eastern Rite Christians. However, not every Eastern Rite Christian visitor was a pilgrim or seminarian. Rather, Eastern Rite Christian legates often came to Rome to gauge the sitting pope’s willingness to arbitrate jurisdictional disputes, aid them financially, or assist them in liturgical reform. This essay explores legates from the Syriac Orthodox Church of Antioch and the Assyrian Church of the East who traveled to Rome to assess whether the sitting pope was willing to recognize the election of their respective patriarchs. This suggests that, while these legates denied papal primacy, they believed that the popes, functioning as Patriarch of Rome, were important leaders in a pan-Mediterranean Christian ecumene. These case studies of Eastern Rite Christians engaging with Rome, the popes, the Curia, and Catholic missionaries should compel us to rethink how religious minorities experienced and understood Roman Catholicism, and to recognize that Rome’s early modern visitors were as integral to giving the Eternal City meaning as were popes and potentates.</note></biblStruct><bibl type="formatted" subtype="bibliography" resp="https://www.zotero.org/styles/chicago-note-bibliography-17th-edition">
