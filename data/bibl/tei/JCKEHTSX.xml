This project examines one of those citations in-depth: a damaged passage from the Syriac Book of the Laws of Countries ("BLC") quoted in Greek in the Praeparatio Evangelica of Eusebius. Part I introduces the problem and the texts. Attention is given to general questions such as the name, authorship, date, original language, and editorial history of the BLC. The damaged texts and their intact parallels are given in translation, and their basic editorial history is established. Part II details the history of scholarly mistakes and abuses to which these passages have been subject since the 19th century. Part III examines the implication of these passages and their history of misuse for LGBTQ history, the history of preliterate Europe, the meaning of arsenokoites, and other topics. The prospects for an English critical edition of the BLC are assessed and various proposed paths for future research are summarized. The appendices provide a partial conjectural restoration of the damaged passages and a list of foreign scholarship proposed for complete translation.</note></biblStruct><bibl type="formatted" subtype="bibliography" resp="https://www.zotero.org/styles/chicago-note-bibliography-17th-edition">
