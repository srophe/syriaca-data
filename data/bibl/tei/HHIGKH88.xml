Morrow brought these covenants together from obscure monasteries, collections and out of print books, arguing against the accepted understanding that these are forgeries. The Prophet’s interaction with the Christians of Najrān is well documented in the Islamic sources, as well as in The Chronicle of Seert, an ecclesiastical history of the Assyrian Church of the East. Yet, no close study of the similarities and differences of the Prophet’s encounter with them has been done, nor comparison of the Islamic sources with what has been related in the Covenant with the Christians of Najran and its Exordium. Doing so provides greater clarity not only in determining the authenticity and authority of the covenants but also in assessing the reliability of the Islamic historical source material. In this paper, a cross-comparison of all the covenants now available is undertaken using source-critical methods. Thereafter, it is argued that categorical dismissal of the covenants as forgeries is no longer tenable. We may then join Charles Upton who, in the Foreword to Morrow’s book, remarked that ‘we may in fact be witnessing—unexpectedly, miraculously, at this extremely late date—the emergence of a third foundational source for Islam’ after the Qurʾān and the ḥadīth.</note></biblStruct><bibl type="formatted" subtype="bibliography" resp="https://www.zotero.org/styles/chicago-note-bibliography-17th-edition">
