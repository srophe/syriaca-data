This is the result of an over-reliance on late 19th- and early 20th-century Orientalist scholarship, which sought to show the all-encompassing influence of Christianity in global history, and is often repeated in modern works without critical attention. In this article, I explore claims that Christianity arrived in Korea and Japan prior to the 9th century. I offer a critical assessment of these claims in order to suggest that they do not have an historical basis. Similarly, I seek to question what evidence we have to suggest that Christianity was present in pre-Táng dynasty China. I seek to illustrate that reliance on early scholarship has resulted in a number of fictional claims, which either cannot be maintained or require more research. The article seeks to act as a starting point for greater criticism of a number of assumptions made by scholars of early East Asian Christianity, historians and missiologists alike.</note></biblStruct><bibl type="formatted" subtype="bibliography" resp="https://www.zotero.org/styles/chicago-note-bibliography-17th-edition">
