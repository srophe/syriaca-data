This study evaluates the burial customs of the Syriac Orthodox from the human skeletal remains found during excavations at the Mor Yaqub churchyard cemetery in Nusaybin, in south-east Turkey. The excavations were carried out in 2013, directed by the Mardin Archaeological Museum as part of its Culture and Faith Park Project. As part of the project the burial traditions of the Syriac community from the past to the present were investigated. Macroscopic bioarchaeological excavation techniques were followed and 33 graves were unearthed. There appear to be 66 individuals: 43 adults, 23 infants and juveniles. Of the adults: 11 are female; 14 are male; the remaining 18 are unsexed. Multiple burial customs have been observed from the graves examined. This study illustrates that the burial customs of the Syriac Orthodox have passed from generation to generation, surviving even until today.</note></biblStruct><bibl type="formatted" subtype="bibliography" resp="https://www.zotero.org/styles/chicago-note-bibliography-17th-edition">
