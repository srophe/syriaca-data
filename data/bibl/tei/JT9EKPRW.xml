His imprint on the Syriac world in particular involved a fifth century translation of his work, the Kephalaia Gnostica, known as Syriac 1 (S1). Until the twentieth century, scholars agreed that this adaptation was an accurate translation of Evagrius’s original Greek. However, when a more theologically unorthodox translation, Syriac 2 (S2), was discovered in the 1950s, scholars came to realize that Evagrius’s original work may have included Neoplatonic and Origenist rhetoric. Yet the translation that shaped Syriac Christianity was S1, a more orthodox adaptation of the original. In this paper, I examine portions of the S1 and S2 translations, demonstrating that this mystery adapter did more than just expurgate Evagrius’s writing; he expanded upon it, clarified imprecise language, added context, and theologically reworked the text. This alteration of the work was both theologically personal and practically accessible. It impacted Evagrius's personal legacy, shaped the reception of Christianity in Syria, and altered the theological landscape of the Late Antique Mediterranean.</note></biblStruct><bibl type="formatted" subtype="bibliography" resp="https://www.zotero.org/styles/chicago-note-bibliography-17th-edition">
