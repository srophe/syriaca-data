These missions were to focus not on proselytizing non-Christians, but on working to revitalize the indigenous Christian churches. The primary method for this work was the establishment of school systems, from common schools through colleges.
These schools were to increase the literacy rate among the population and train clergy and teachers. The methods used in these schools were brought over from the schools then in place in America. The study considers the results of this replication of American educational purposes on to a different context.
This thesis focuses on the mission among the Nestorian people in eastern Turkey and northwestern Iran. The study identifies the socio-historical context of the Nestorians, the motivations of the missionaries and the structures and curricula of the schools.
The study describes and analyzes the results of this mission effort, especially in regard to this activity as an experience of intercultural contact. In doing this, the study evaluates the credibility of the several sources, to assess causal relationships and to determine the nature and characteristics of change over time, and then constructs this research into an historical story.</note></biblStruct><bibl type="formatted" subtype="bibliography" resp="https://www.zotero.org/styles/chicago-note-bibliography-17th-edition">
