As a result of the application of these methodologies, it has been demonstrated that the Didascalist's immediate source - the "Gospel," as the Didascalist himself refers to it again and again - is not to be defined as any individual Gospel (e g. the &lt;i&gt;Gospel of Matthew&lt;/i&gt;), or any collection of Gospels (e g. the Synoptics), nor is it to be defined as a "harmony" of the Gospels. Kather it is to be defined as the entire body of "Gospel" traditions available to the Didascalist - a body of traditions that consisted, as far as the evidence in the Didascalia itself will allow definition, in the main, of a collection or, more probably, collections of &lt;i&gt;logoi Jesu &lt;/i&gt;- collections which, like the collections of &lt;i&gt;logoi Jesu&lt;/i&gt;, Q, and the &lt;i&gt;Gospel of Thomas&lt;/i&gt;, contained comparatively little, if any gospel narrative material.
All of the dominical &lt;i&gt;logoi &lt;/i&gt;analyzed in these "studies" probably derive &lt;i&gt;inmmediately &lt;/i&gt;from such collections of &lt;i&gt;logoi Jesu&lt;/i&gt;, e.g., the &lt;i&gt;logoi &lt;/i&gt;cited at Didasc. I.1.7 and III.11.3 (Study, II), Didasc. II.16.1 and VI.14.4 (Study, IV), Didasc. II.36.9 (Study, VI), and Didasc. VI.13.3 and VI.14.8 (Study, VII) undoubtedly derive &lt;i&gt;immediately &lt;/i&gt;from such collections; the logos cited at Didasc. I.1.4 (Stzldy, I ) probably derives &lt;i&gt;immediately &lt;/i&gt;from such collections; and the &lt;i&gt;logoi &lt;/i&gt;cited at Didasc. I.6.10, II.34.7, VI.12.11, and VI.17.6 (Study, III), and Didasc. II.20.1 and II.32.2 (Study, V) likely derive irrznzediately from such collections.
Those collections consisted of&lt;i&gt; logoi Jesu&lt;/i&gt; that were derived ultimately from a variety of sources: (i) the &lt;i&gt;canonical Gospels&lt;/i&gt;, e.g.. the logoi cited at Didasc. I.6.10, II.34.7, VI.12.11, and VI.17.6 (Study, III) and Didasc. VI.13.3 and VI.14.8 (Study, VII) clearly derive ultimately from the &lt;i&gt;Gospel of Matthew&lt;/i&gt;, and the &lt;i&gt;logoi&lt;/i&gt; cited at Didasc. II.20.1 and II.32.2 (Study, V) clearly derives &lt;i&gt;ultimately&lt;/i&gt; from the &lt;i&gt;Gospel of Luke&lt;/i&gt;: and (ii) &lt;i&gt;non-canonical sources&lt;/i&gt;, e.g., the &lt;i&gt;logoi &lt;/i&gt;cited at Didasc. I.1.7 and III.11.3 (Study, II), Didasc. II.16.1 and VI.14.4 (Study, IV), and Didasc. II.36.9 (Study, VI) clearly derive ultirrzately from a source, or sources, quite independent of the Synoptic Gospels, though, in the case of the logoi cited at Didasc. I.1.7 and III.11.3 (Study, II) and Didasc. II.16.1 and VI.14.4 (Study, IV), parallel to them.</note></biblStruct><bibl type="formatted" subtype="bibliography" resp="https://www.zotero.org/styles/chicago-note-bibliography-17th-edition">
