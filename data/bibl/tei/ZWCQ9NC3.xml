In the 4th century, bishops could exercise direct and decisive influence on the emperor; holy men succeeded them in this role during the 5th century. Daniel the Stylite is the prime example of a holy man engaged in imperial politics, acting as the personal adviser of Emperor Leo I. Taking up his abode on top of a pillar near Constantinople, Daniel’s spiritual authority gradually increased through the working of miracles and successful intercessory prayers. Hence, members of the imperial elite and finally the emperor himself consulted him on personal affairs, but also on political matters pertaining to the entire empire. These contacts were in the interest of both the persons of secular authority and the holy man: it increased the political legitimacy of the former and fostered the authority of the latter.</note></biblStruct><bibl type="formatted" subtype="bibliography" resp="https://www.zotero.org/styles/chicago-note-bibliography-17th-edition">
