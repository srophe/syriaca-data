Some of these Christian translators were no mere translators any more, but genuine scholars. The chief architect among them was Yahya Ibn ‘Adi. He was not only the leader of his group but was also dubbed as the best Christian translator, logician and theologian of his times. This is justified, in addition, by his ample productivity in those fields of enquiry. A considerable number of such works have evidently been used by contemporary and later writers, and have also reached us today. Hence we consider that it is in these aspects that his distinctive contributions to scholarship lie, and therefore he deserves more serious study. This qualitative work, thus, seeks to make an analytical study of Yahya Ibn ‘Adi’s theory of the nature of man and his soul, as well as the effects of the soul on human character as reflected in his major work on ethics, Tahdhib al-Akhlaq (The Refinement of Character).</note></biblStruct><bibl type="formatted" subtype="bibliography" resp="https://www.zotero.org/styles/chicago-note-bibliography-17th-edition">
