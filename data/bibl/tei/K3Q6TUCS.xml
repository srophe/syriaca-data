Drawing on the rich literary traditions of Arabic and Syriac, as well as on the much leaner material evidence that dates from the period, it charts the emergence of Mosul during the late antique/early Islamic transition, stressing the continuities of early Islamic rule. The purpose of this study is to place the history of Mosul into the broader context of the experience of northern Mesopotamia in the period. This is particularly the case on the eve of the Islamic conquests and during the Marwanid period. Starting at the turn of the first Islamic century our source material for Mosul improves dramatically, and as it does, the focus of this study sharpens on Mosul itself. Part I describes the ecological setting of northern Mesopotamia and provides the social and political background necessary to understand the birth of the city of Mosul. It similarly tries to set the scene for the emergence of tribal opposition to the nascent Islamic regime. Part II assays an interpretation of early Islamic administration in northern Mesopotamia until the Second Civil War. Here it is argued that the provincial administration of Mosul and the Jazira was based largely on local intermediaries. This system of rule was dismantled by the Marwanids, under whom the administration of northern Mesopotamia and the city of Mosul itself underwent significant transformations. Part III describes the emergence of the local tribalism that was characteristic of Mosul in the medieval period. Particular attention is paid to the nature of central/provincial relations during the early Abbasid period.</note></biblStruct><bibl type="formatted" subtype="bibliography" resp="https://www.zotero.org/styles/chicago-note-bibliography-17th-edition">
