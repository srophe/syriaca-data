It presents the Crusades as an extension of the conflict between Christianity and Islam, which began with the Arabs’ first incursions into Christian territory in the seventh century and continued with their conquest of the Iberian peninsula. It discusses the evils perpetrated by both sides in the name of religion, and it details the internal struggles that weakened both the Muslims and the European invaders. The book is broad in scope, examining not only the Christians’ efforts to take control of Jerusalem but also relatively minor campaigns against other perceived enemies of the church. It portrays clearly those larger-than-life figures who played major roles in the history of the period, from Pope Urban to Richard the Lion-Hearted and Saladin. Although the Crusades ended centuries ago, the conflict they embodied is still being carried on today, not only in the Middle East but around the globe.</note></biblStruct><bibl type="formatted" subtype="bibliography" resp="https://www.zotero.org/styles/chicago-note-bibliography-17th-edition">
