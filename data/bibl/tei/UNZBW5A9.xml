It pays attention to his dependence on the ancient versions, in particular the Septuagint. Thus it seeks to show how the Syriac translator has interpreted the Hebrew text and to explain the divergences between the texts, where such occur. The introductory chapter reviews critically the exegetical value of the ancient versions, as well as connoting the fundamental differences between the Hebrew and Syriac languages. It also notes the various characteristics of the Peshitta of Job, which are then illustrated by examples drawn from the entire corpus of the book of Job. The second chapter begins by defending the principle that this kind of research is best conducted by writing a continuous commentary on the book of Job. Thus this work has restricted itself to Job 3-10 because of the spatial requirements imposed upon it. The remainder of the this chapter contains the commentary on Job 3. 1-4. 21. The third chapter contains the commentary on Job 5. 1-6. 30. The fourth chapter contains the commentary on Job 7. 1-8. 22. The fifth chapter contains the commentary on 9. 1-10. 22. The sixth chapter provides a summary and conclusion</note></biblStruct><bibl type="formatted" subtype="bibliography" resp="https://www.zotero.org/styles/chicago-note-bibliography-17th-edition">
