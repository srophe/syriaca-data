They were recognized in Yohannes Maron’s leadership as a different community in Christian world. A long period following Maron’s death is not known well. During the period of the Crusades, they built close relationship with the Christian World. Although they had lived under ottomans sovereignty following the conquest of Syria and Egypt by Ottomans, they were particularly affected by French cultural and political influences. In nineteenth century there were important changes in social and economical architecture of Ottomans and rest of the world. Consequently, coastal regions with rich economical surroundings and port-town such as İzmir, Mersin, Beirut, and Haifa developed rapidly. The fact that a Maronite church was started out at Mersin in this period indicates the formation of a Maronites community. For different reasons, over the time, Maronites emigrated from their homeland to different countries. In nineteenth century majority appear to immigrate to America and a small number of the community settled in Adana, Tarsus, and Mersin. There are different views about the reason for their migration. In this study, demographical records of Maronites who settled in Mersin were evaluated.</note></biblStruct><bibl type="formatted" subtype="bibliography" resp="https://www.zotero.org/styles/chicago-note-bibliography-17th-edition">
