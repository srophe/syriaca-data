This passage of apotropaic character, consisting of either four or seven Greek letters/seals, is usually followed by their explanation. The earliest evidences of attaching the seals to the letter of the Saviour and their Latin counterpart(s), as well as their relationship to the concept of the divine names are discussed. A reconstructed probable Syriac original, together with plausible reasons for inclusion of the observed phenomenon within the main body of the apocryphon is provided. Examples of the iconographical seals of Christ, attached to the acheiropoiētos image (Mandylion) of the Saviour preserved in Georgian and Cappadocian representations of the relic are examined and their correlation with the seals attached to the epistle of Jesus is verified. Finally, an attempt to prove that the miniature containing the Edessan image from the fourteenth-century Oxford Menologion preserves earliest mode of painting the seals on the cloth of the acheiropoiētos image is given.</note></biblStruct><bibl type="formatted" subtype="bibliography" resp="https://www.zotero.org/styles/chicago-note-bibliography-17th-edition">
