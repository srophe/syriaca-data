Chapter I covers ‘Wesley the Man’; Chapter IIB, the Apostolic Fathers, who preserved the tradition when early Christianity was without the Gospels and Wesley uses Chapter IIB as the first half of Book 1 of his Concise Ecclesiastical History (CEH) while leaving the last half to cover the first English translation of twenty-two of the fifty homilies of St. Macarius the Great; correcting, while he does this, the errors in the text of the Apostolic Fathers that was available to him and, to his credit, receiving the acknowledgment of modern patristics scholars as to the correctness of his judgment in omitting obvious errors. Chapters III and IV were reserved for the church fathers who defended Christianity against its foes external (the Apologists) and internal (the Heretic Hunters). Chapters V, VI, and VII summarize the very significant influence on Wesley’s maturing through and life that was the product of his study of the Greek, Latin, and Syriac Fathers especially his reading of Macarius ‘the Great’ and Ephrem Syrus and their influence on his understanding of Christian perfection and the spiritual life. In conclusion, then, the mature Wesley emerges an historically sensitive, profound Christian theologian whose movement is the beneficiary of his remarkable talents in his many endeavors: writing, preaching, teaching, editing, etc., too many to be catalogued.</note></biblStruct><bibl type="formatted" subtype="bibliography" resp="https://www.zotero.org/styles/chicago-note-bibliography-17th-edition">
