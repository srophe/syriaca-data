AD, appeared to be widespread in the narratives on Armenia and Mount Ararat in the travel notes of European travellers. The narrative about St. Hakob’s climbing up to the Noah’s Ark and returning with its particle, is narrated in the travel notes by foreign travellers Rubruck, Saint-Quentin, Mandeville, Newbury, Cartwright, La Boule-Le Guz, Chardin, Lucas, Tournefort, Gardane, Ker Porter, Dubois de Monperreux, Parrot, Kotzebue, Thielmann, Belanger and others.
As a rule, the travellers’ notes are mainly composed of the same elements: in separate travel notes, only their correlation changes. From the general arsenal of traditional formula-motives, the narrator chooses one or another version, depending on individual addictions and used sources (written or oral). However, in a number of travelogues (Kotzebue, Thielmann, Belanger), one can see St. Hakob’s replacement by Gregory the Illuminator. The thing is that the particle of the Noah’s Ark granted to St. Hakob by the Lord, was transferred from St. Hakob Monastery to Ayrivank, and from there to Etchmiadzin.
In connection with its location, it became necessary to create a new myth. Narrating the story of St. Hakob’s climbing Ararat, the clergy of Etchmiadzin Monastery began to link it to Etchmiadzin. Thereby, however, the process of mythmaking did not cease: the aquisition of the relic kept in Etchmiadzin began to be considered the merit of St. Gregory, whose name was associated with the construction of the Cathedral shortly after the conversion of the Armenians to Christianity in the place where Christ had descended from heaven in the saint’s vision. The substitution of St. Hakob by St. Gregory was designed to complement the substantial logical succession: Ararat – Gregory the Illuminator, the founder of the monastery – the Etchmiadzin Monastery – the relic preserved in the monastery.</note></biblStruct><bibl type="formatted" subtype="bibliography" resp="https://www.zotero.org/styles/chicago-note-bibliography-17th-edition">
