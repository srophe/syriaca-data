Thus, he used the Syriac sources extensively beginning from Ephrem and Aphrahaat, whom are considered by all Christian communities as a common root for their teaching, and he continues through the selected writings from both traditions. Through the reading of the text, it is noteworthy that MbK intentionally avoids using the controversial, dogmatic watchwords, but rather explaining them in a way, which most thought to be acceptable by all Christian groups. Moreover, MbK criticized the Greek exegetes of the East Syriac tradition, namely Theodore of Mopsustia, on certain notions, which other East Syriac writers also do. Likewise, he does not spare exegetes from his own tradition from criticism on various issues. But most noticeably, MbK ignores the exegesis of Cyril of Alexandria, namely, Cyril's &lt;i&gt;Commentary on Luke&lt;/i&gt;, though it was translated into Syriac. MbK's &lt;i&gt;Commentary&lt;/i&gt; reintroduces the Syriac communities its own exegetical and spiritual literature in an illuminating and inspiring way. It would be for the first time after more than seven centuries that the communities would have access to their own legacy. As MbK's &lt;i&gt;Commentary&lt;/i&gt; enhanced the credibility of the Christian faith, spirituality and heritage, likewise, it is the responsibility of the communities today to assume that role in this new and challenging world. As for Syriac Studies scholarship, the &lt;i&gt;Commentary&lt;/i&gt; will respond to many awaited questions, but with that it will also open further areas for research. In addition to the valuable work of MbK by itself, some scholars will finally find their answer to question, how much did MbK impact the later East and West Syriac exegetes? And to what extent does MbK use and incorporate the earlier sources? For example, J. Sanders questions and speculates on the impact on the later East Syriac (Nestorian) exegete, Ibn at-Tayyab; similarly, G. Reinink argues that MbK uses the East Syriac exegete Mar Aba (d. 751), and he speculates the possibility of retrieving more of Mar Aba's lost work. In the section of The Sources of MbK's Commentary on Luke, the exegetical works of Ephrem (d. 373), Philoxenus of Mabbug (d. 523), Išodad of Merv (c 850) and Dionysisu Bar Salibi (d. 1177) were studied in relation to MbK's &lt;i&gt;Commentary on Luke&lt;/i&gt;.
