The aim of this study was to thoroughly investigate for the first time the history and unknown pre-history of First and Second Thessalonians in Syriac. The method employed was to examine important Syriac MSS, collate them with the Peshitta version, and arrange them into a textual apparatus for 1 Thessalonians 1 and 4 and 2 Thessalonians 1, laying the groundwork for later expansion to all eight chapters of the Thessalonian epistles. Dozens of MSS were examined consisting of biblical texts in the Peshitta, Palestinian Syriac, and Harklean versions, lectionaries, and commentaries by twenty-one Syrian Fathers. Commentaries by Moshe Bar Kepha and Dionysios Bar Salibi are analyzed in depth. Some of their Biblical quotations, substantiated by the Old Latin, Old Armenian, and Old Georgian versions, seemed to point to a version older than Peshitta. This may well have been the second century Old Syriac, of which the Peshitta was a revision. Now extant only in the Gospels, it is a reasonable hypothesis that the Old Syriac at one time embraced most, if not all, of the Antiochenean NT and is partially perpetuated in the writings of those who quoted it and in later versions that revised it. Some of the principles confirmed by a developmental historical overview of the Syriac texts are:  (1) The more a reading is unlike the Peshitta and the Greek text, the more likely that it is a remnant of the Old Syriac; (2) The more patristic and early version support there is for a non-Peshitta, non-Greek reading, the greater the probability that the reading in question represents their common source, which source may be sought after in the Vetus Syra; (3) The greater the antiquity of the patristic author of the MS under consideration, the greater the likelihood that the Biblical text quoted is based on the Old Syriac. When more features of the Old Syriac become visible, they should describe the profile of what the Old Syriac must have looked like in the Apostolos. The complete profile for this part of the Scriptures awaits a later time.</note></biblStruct><bibl type="formatted" subtype="bibliography" resp="https://www.zotero.org/styles/chicago-note-bibliography-17th-edition">
