                    is most commonly referred to by modern scholars as the Apocalypse of Pseudo-Ezra
                    (Ps.-Ezra). It is a historical apocalyptic text that claims authorship by the
                    biblical character Ezra, but there is no question that it is the pseudonymous
                    product of a much later Syriac-speaking Christian author who writes in response
                    to the Arab conquests and subsequent consolidation of Arab political and
                    religious dominance under the caliphate. Ps.-Ezra is a brief work, but an
                    enigmatic one, and has received only scant scholarly attention. Although
                    nineteenth- century translations based on three individual manuscripts were made
                    into German, French, and English respectively, no critical edition or full-scale
                    study based on multiple manuscripts has yet appeared.
The primary goal of
                    this project, then, is to produce an edition of the Syriac Ps.-Ezra with a
                    critical apparatus noting variants in the manuscript tradition. The edition is
                    accompanied by an English translation in order to make Ps.-Ezra accessible to a
                    wider range of scholars and students. To orient readers to the text, an
                    introduction to and analysis of Ps.-Ezra is provided. In my approach, I am most
                    interested in studying Ps.-Ezra as an example of the ways that Syriac-speaking
                    Christians used the genre of apocalypse to reconcile their deeply held
                    theological and historical expectations with their often different lived
                    realities. In particular, the thesis highlights the ways Pseudo-Ezra used,
                    reused, and reimagined sacred texts in order to respond to the theological
                    challenges presented by Arab rule.</note></biblStruct><bibl type="formatted" subtype="bibliography" resp="https://www.zotero.org/styles/chicago-note-bibliography-17th-edition">
