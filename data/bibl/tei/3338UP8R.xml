I have argued, in this dissertation, that it is. There exists, clearly, a relationship between the two rites of initiation: the monastic profession and baptism. This dissertation examines these two rites of initiation and then compares the rite of monastic profession with that of baptism, both in external structure and theological themes in order to reveal how the monastic rite closely parallels, or even is modeled upon, that of baptism. It also identifies the common imagery and themes between them, and then explores the idea of monastic profession as a "second baptism", or rather, the realization of what the gift of the Spirit at baptism really implies.

Chapter One introduces the issues that underlie the subject of the dissertation and then provides the relevant history of scholarship focusing, especially, on the work of a number of diverse scholars in the field.

Chapter Two explores the Syriac "proto-monastic" tradition and the way it fits into the development of monasticism in the fourth century.

Chapter Three examines the West-Syriac rite of monastic profession. First, it offers a description and study of ancient Syriac texts and manuscripts pertinent to monastic profession. Second, it explores the structure as well as the rites and rituals of the monastic profession with necessary explanation and commentary. The new evidence of this work will be important for historians and liturgical scholars since it will shed further light on the nature and transmission of the West-Syriac rite of monastic profession.

Chapter Four explores the two West-Syriac rites of initiation in terms of their structure and demonstrates the parallels that exist between baptism and monastic profession. It then identifies the common imagery and themes between them, and explores the idea of monastic profession as a "second baptism". The Conclusion reiterates and summarizes these themes and offers suggestions for further study.

In addition, there is an extensive Appendix containing Syriac texts with English translations pertaining to the Syriac rite of monastic profession with relevant commentaries by Syriac Fathers spanning from the 6th to 10th century.</note></biblStruct><bibl type="formatted" subtype="bibliography" resp="https://www.zotero.org/styles/chicago-note-bibliography-17th-edition">
